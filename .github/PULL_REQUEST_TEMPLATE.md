IMPORTANT

Nix is a non-trivial project, so for your contribution to be successful,
it really is important to follow the contributing guidelines:

https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Even if you've contributed to open source before, take a moment to read it,
so you understand the process and the expectations.

- what information to include in commit messages
- proper attribution
- volunteering contributions effectively
- how to get help and our review process.

PR stuck in review? We have two Nix team meetings per week online that are open for everyone in a jitsi conference:
