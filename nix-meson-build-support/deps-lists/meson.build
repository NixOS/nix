# These are private dependencies with pkg-config files. What private
# means is that the dependencies are used by the library but they are
# *not* used (e.g. `#include`-ed) in any installed header file, and only
# in regular source code (`*.cc`) or private, uninstalled headers. They
# are thus part of the *implementation* of the library, but not its
# *interface*.
#
# See `man pkg-config` for some details.

# These are public dependencies with pkg-config files. Public is the
# opposite of private: these dependencies are used in installed header
# files. They are part of the interface (and implementation) of the
# library.
#
# N.B. This concept is mostly unrelated to our own concept of a public
# (stable) API, for consumption outside of the Nix repository.
# `libnixutil` is an unstable C++ library, whose public interface is
# likewise unstable. `libutilc` conversely is a hopefully-soon stable
# C library, whose public interface --- including public but not private
# dependencies --- will also likewise soon be stable.
#
# N.B. For distributions that care about "ABI" stability and not just
# "API" stability, the private dependencies also matter as they can
# potentially affect the public ABI.
