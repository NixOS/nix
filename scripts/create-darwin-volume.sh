    # 2) system is in some sense less secure than user keychain... (it's
    # possible to read the password for decrypting the keychain) but
    # the user keychain appears to be available too late. As far as I
    # can tell, the file with this password (/var/db/SystemKey) is
    # inside the FileVault envelope. If that isn't true, it may make
    # sense to store the password inside the envelope?

    # as the daemon itself, and for it to replace /usr/bin/security here.
