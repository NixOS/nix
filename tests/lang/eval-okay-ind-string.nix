  s1 = ''
    This is an indented multi-line string
    literal.  An amount of whitespace at
    the start of each line matching the minimum
    indentation of all lines in the string
    literal together will be removed.  Thus,
    in this case four spaces will be
    stripped from each line, even though
      THIS LINE is indented six spaces.

    Also, empty lines don't count in the
    determination of the indentation level (the
    previous empty line has indentation 0, but
    it doesn't matter).
  '';

  s2 = ''  If the string starts with whitespace
    followed by a newline, it's stripped, but
    that's not the case here. Two spaces are
    stripped because of the "  " at the start. 
  '';

  s3 = ''
      This line is indented
      a bit further.
        ''; # indentation of last line doesn't count if it's empty

  s4 = ''
    Anti-quotations, like ${if true then "so" else "not so"}, are
    also allowed.
  '';

  s5 = ''
      The \ is not special here.
    ' can be followed by any character except another ', e.g. 'x'.
    Likewise for $, e.g. $$ or $varName.
    But ' followed by ' is special, as is $ followed by {.
    If you want them, use anti-quotations: ${"''"}, ${"\${"}.
  '';

  s6 = ''  
    Tabs are not interpreted as whitespace (since we can't guess
    what tab settings are intended), so don't use them.
 	This line starts with a space and a tab, so only one
    space will be stripped from each line.
  '';

  s7 = ''
    Also note that if the last line (just before the closing ' ')
    consists only of whitespace, it's ignored.  But here there is
    some non-whitespace stuff, so the line isn't removed. '';

  s8 = ''    ${}
    This shows a hacky way to preserve an empty line after the start.
    But there's no reason to do so: you could just repeat the empty
    line.
  '';

  s9 = ''
  ${}  Similarly you can force an indentation level,
    in this case to 2 spaces.  This works because the anti-quote
    is significant (not whitespace).
