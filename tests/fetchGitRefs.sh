# Test various combinations of ref names

# git help check-ref-format
#       Git imposes the following rules on how references are named:
#
#        1. They can include slash / for hierarchical (directory) grouping, but no slash-separated component can begin with a dot .  or end with the sequence .lock.
#        2. They must contain at least one /. This enforces the presence of a category like heads/, tags/ etc. but the actual names are not restricted. If the --allow-onelevel option is used, this rule is waived.
#        3. They cannot have two consecutive dots ..  anywhere.
#        4. They cannot have ASCII control characters (i.e. bytes whose values are lower than \040, or \177 DEL), space, tilde ~, caret ^, or colon : anywhere.
#        5. They cannot have question-mark ?, asterisk *, or open bracket [ anywhere. See the --refspec-pattern option below for an exception to this rule.
#        6. They cannot begin or end with a slash / or contain multiple consecutive slashes (see the --normalize option below for an exception to this rule)
#        7. They cannot end with a dot ..
#        8. They cannot contain a sequence @{.
#        9. They cannot be the single character @.
#       10. They cannot contain a \.
