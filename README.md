Nix makes computation repeatable.

It treats file system data like memory in a data flow program:
- Ensures referential integrity
- Enables caching and deduplication
- Performs garbage collection

This allows getting computer programs from one machine to another â€” and having them still work when they get there.

management reliable and reproducible.

It forces operating system processes to act like pure functions:
- Output only changes if input changes
- Composable as independent, reusable units
- Deterministic and safe to parallelise

Think of it as running `execve()` in a clean environment on read-only data and caching the output.
Or think of it as functional programming with files and directories.
