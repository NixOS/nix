Nix, the purely functional package manager
------------------------------------------

Nix is a new take on package management that is fairly unique. Because of its
purity aspects, a lot of issues found in traditional package managers don't
appear with Nix.

*Darwinix* is an OSX-specific port of nix that integrates more tightly with Xcode,
avoiding a host of problems introduced by the fact that the vast majority of OSX's system
libraries are closed-source.

To find out more about the tool, usage and installation instructions, please
read the manual, which is available on the Nix website at
<http://nixos.org/nix/manual>.
