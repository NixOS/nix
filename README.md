Nix, the purely functional package manager
------------------------------------------

Nix is a new take on package management that is fairly unique. Because of its
purity aspects, a lot of issues found in traditional package managers don't
appear with Nix.

To find out more about the tool, usage and installation instructions, please
read the manual, which is available on the Nix website at
<http://nixos.org/nix/manual>.
