Nix makes computation repeatable.

It treats file system data like memory in a data flow program:
- Ensures referential integrity
- Enables caching and deduplication
- Performs garbage collection

This allows getting computer programs from one machine to another â€” and having them still work when they get there.

management reliable and reproducible.

It forces operating system processes to act like pure functions:
- Output only changes if input changes
- Composable as independent, reusable units
- Deterministic and safe to parallelise

Think of it as running `execve()` in a clean environment on read-only data and caching the output.
Or think of it as functional programming with files and directories.

## Building and developing

See our [Hacking guide](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/contributing/hacking.html) in our manual for instruction on how to
 set up a development environment and build Nix from source.

## Contributing

Check the [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to get involved with developing Nix.

## Additional resources

Nix was created by Eelco Dolstra and developed as the subject of his PhD thesis [The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf), published 2006.
Today, a world-wide developer community contributes to Nix and the ecosystem that has grown around it.
