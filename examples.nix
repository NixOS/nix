  # Return an attribute from nested attribute sets.

  # Example

    x = { a = { b = 3; }; }
    # ["a" "b"] is equivalent to x.a.b
    # 6 is a default value to return if the path does not exist in attrset
    attrByPath ["a" "b"] 6 x
    => 3

  /**
    Like builtins.foldl' but for attribute sets.
    Iterates over every name-value pair in the given attribute set.
    The result of the callback function is often called `acc` for accumulator. It is passed between callbacks from left to right and the final `acc` is the return value of `foldlAttrs`.

    Attention:
    There is a completely different function
    `lib.foldAttrs`
    which has nothing to do with this function, despite the similar name.

    # Example

    ```nix
    foldlAttrs
      (acc: name: value: {
        sum = acc.sum + value;
        names = acc.names ++ [name];
      })
      { sum = 0; names = []; }
      {
        foo = 1;
        bar = 10;
      }
    ->
      {
        sum = 11;
        names = ["bar" "foo"];
      }

    foldlAttrs
      (throw "function not needed")
      123
      {};
    ->
      123

    foldlAttrs
      (_: _: v: v)
      (throw "initial accumulator not needed")
      { z = 3; a = 2; };
    ->
      3

    The accumulator doesn't have to be an attrset.
    It can be as simple as a number or string.

    foldlAttrs
      (acc: _: v: acc * 10 + v)
      1
      { z = 1; a = 2; };
    ->
      121
    ```

    # Type

    ```
    foldlAttrs :: ( a -> String -> b -> a ) -> a -> { ... :: b } -> a
    ```
