    /**
     * @note Unlike Unix paths, URLs provide a way to escape path
     * separators, in the form of the `%2F` encoding of `/`. That means
     * that if one percent-decodes the path into a single string, that
     * decoding will be *lossy*, because `/` and `%2F` both become `/`.
     * The right thing to do is instead split up the path on `/`, and
     * then percent decode each part.
     *
     * For an example, the path
     * ```
     * foo/bar%2Fbaz/quux
     * ```
     * is parsed as
     * ```
     * {"foo, "bar/baz", "quux"}
     * ```
     *
     * We're doing splitting and joining that assumes the separator (`/` in this case) only goes *between* elements.
     *
     * That means the parsed representation will begin with an empty
     * element to make an initial `/`, and will end with an ementy
     * element to make a trailing `/`. That means that elements of this
     * vector mostly, but *not always*, correspond to segments of the
     * path.
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * - ```
     *   https://foo.com/bar
     *   ```
     *   has path
     *   ```
     *   {"", "bar"}
     *   ```
     *
     * - ```
     *   https://foo.com/bar/
     *   ```
     *   has path
     *   ```
     *   {"", "bar", ""}
     *   ```
     *
     * - ```
     *   https://foo.com//bar///
     *   ```
     *   has path
     *   ```
     *   {"", "", "bar", "", "", ""}
     *   ```
     *
     * - ```
     *   https://foo.com
     *   ```
     *   has path
     *   ```
     *   {""}
     *   ```
     *
     * - ```
     *   https://foo.com/
     *   ```
     *   has path
     *   ```
     *   {"", ""}
     *   ```
     *
     * - ```
     *   tel:01234
     *   ```
     *   has path `{"01234"}` (and no authority)
     *
     * - ```
     *   foo:/01234
     *   ```
     *   has path `{"", "01234"}` (and no authority)
     *
     * Note that both trailing and leading slashes are, in general,
     * semantically significant.
     *
     * For trailing slashes, the main example affecting many schemes is
     * that `../baz` resolves against a base URL different depending on
     * the presence/absence of a trailing slash:
     *
     * - `https://foo.com/bar` is `https://foo.com/baz`
     *
     * - `https://foo.com/bar/` is `https://foo.com/bar/baz`
     *
     * See `parseURLRelative` for more details.
     *
     * For leading slashes, there are some requirements to be aware of.
     *
     * - When there is an authority, the path *must* start with a leading
     *   slash. Otherwise the path will not be separated from the
     *   authority, and will not round trip though the parser:
     *
     *   ```
     *   {.scheme="https", .authority.host = "foo", .path={"bad"}}
     *   ```
     *   will render to `https://foobar`. but that would parse back as as
     *   ```
     *   {.scheme="https", .authority.host = "foobar", .path={}}
     *   ```
     *
     * - When there is no authority, the path must *not* begin with two
     *   slashes. Otherwise, there will be another parser round trip
     *   issue:
     *
     *   ```
     *   {.scheme="https", .path={"", "", "bad"}}
     *   ```
     *   will render to `https://bad`. but that would parse back as as
     *   ```
     *   {.scheme="https", .authority.host = "bad", .path={}}
     *   ```
     *
     * These invariants will be checked in `to_string` and
     * `renderAuthorityAndPath`.
