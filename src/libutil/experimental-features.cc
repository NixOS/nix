            Allow derivations to produce non-fixed outputs by setting the
            `__impure` derivation attribute to `true`. An impure derivation can
            have differing outputs each time it is built.

            Example:

            ```
            derivation {
              name = "impure";
              builder = /bin/sh;
              __impure = true; # mark this derivation as impure
              args = [ "-c" "read -n 10 random < /dev/random; echo $random > $out" ];
              system = builtins.currentSystem;
            }
            ```

            Each time this derivation is built, it can produce a different
            output (as the builder outputs random bytes to `$out`).  Impure
            derivations also have access to the network, and only fixed-output
            or other impure derivations can rely on impure derivations. Finally,
            an impure derivation cannot also be
            [content-addressed](#xp-feature-ca-derivations).

            This is a more explicit alternative to using [`builtins.currentTime`](@docroot@/language/builtin-constants.md#builtins-currentTime).

            The [`flakes`](#xp-feature-flakes) feature flag always enables `fetch-tree`.

            with import <nixpkgs> {};

            An important restriction on recursive builders is disallowing
            arbitrary substitutions. For example, running

            ```
            nix-store -r /nix/store/kmwd1hq55akdb9sc7l3finr175dajlby-hello-2.10

            in the above `runCommand` script would be disallowed, as this could
            lead to derivations with hidden dependencies or breaking
            reproducibility by relying on the current state of the Nix store. An
            exception would be if
            `/nix/store/kmwd1hq55akdb9sc7l3finr175dajlby-hello-2.10` were
            already in the build inputs or built by a previous recursive Nix
            call.

            Disallow unquoted URLs as part of the Nix language syntax. The Nix
            language allows for URL literals, like so:

            $ nix repl

            "http://foo"

            throw an error when encountering a URL literal:

            ```
            $ nix repl --extra-experimental-features 'no-url-literals'

            ```

            While this is currently an experimental feature, unquoted URLs are
            being deprecated and their usage is discouraged.

            The reason is that, as opposed to path literals, URLs have no
            special properties that distinguish them from regular strings, URLs
            containing parameters have to be quoted anyway, and unquoted URLs
            may confuse external tooling.
