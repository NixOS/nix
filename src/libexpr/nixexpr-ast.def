# Strings in the evaluator carry a so-called `context' (the ATermList)
# which is a list of strings representing store paths.  This is to
# allow users to write things like
#
#   "--with-freetype2-library=" + freetype + "/lib"
#
# where `freetype' is a derivation (or a source to be copied to the
# store).  If we just concatenated the strings without keeping track
# of the referenced store paths, then if the string is used as a
# derivation attribute, the derivation will not have the correct
# dependencies in its inputDrvs and inputSrcs.
#
# The semantics of the context is as follows: when a string with
# context C is used as a derivation attribute, then the derivations in
# C will be added to the inputDrvs of the derivation, and the other
# store paths in C will be added to the inputSrcs of the derivations.
#
# For canonicity, the store paths should be in sorted order.

# A path is a reference to a file system object that is to be copied
# to the Nix store when used as a derivation attribute.  When it is
# concatenated to a string (i.e., `str + path'), it is also copied and
# the resulting store path is concatenated to the string (with the
# store path in the context).  If a string or path is concatenated to
# a path (i.e., `path + str' or `path + path'), the result is a new
# path (if the right-hand side is a string, the context must be
# empty).
