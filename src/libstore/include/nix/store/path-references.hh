 *
 * The function walks the tree using the provided accessor and streams each file's
 * contents through a RefScanSink to detect hash references. For each file that
 * contains at least one reference, a callback is invoked with the file path and
 * the set of references found.
 *
 * Note: This function only searches for the hash part of store paths (e.g.,
 * "dc04vv14dak1c1r48qa0m23vr9jy8sm0"), not the name part. A store path like
 * "/nix/store/dc04vv14dak1c1r48qa0m23vr9jy8sm0-foo" will be detected if the
 * hash appears anywhere in the scanned content, regardless of the "-foo" suffix.
