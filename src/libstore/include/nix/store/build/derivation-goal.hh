 *
 * This is a purely "administrative" goal type, which doesn't do any
 * "real work" of substituting (that would be `PathSubstitutionGoal` or
 * `DrvOutputSubstitutionGoal`) or building (that would be a
 * `DerivationBuildingGoal`). This goal type creates those types of
 * goals to attempt each way of realisation a derivation; they are tried
 * sequentially in order of preference.
 *
 * The derivation must already be gotten (in memory, in C++, parsed) and passed
 * to the caller. If the derivation itself needs to be gotten first, a
 * `DerivationTrampolineGoal` goal must be used instead.
