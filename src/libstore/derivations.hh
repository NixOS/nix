/* Returns hashes with the details of fixed-output subderivations
   expunged.

   A fixed-output derivation is a derivation whose outputs have a
   specified content hash and hash algorithm. (Currently they must have
   exactly one output (`out'), which is specified using the `outputHash'
   and `outputHashAlgo' attributes, but the algorithm doesn't assume
   this.) We don't want changes to such derivations to propagate upwards
   through the dependency graph, changing output paths everywhere.

   For instance, if we change the url in a call to the `fetchurl'
   function, we do not want to rebuild everything depending on it---after
   all, (the hash of) the file being downloaded is unchanged.  So the
   *output paths* should not change. On the other hand, the *derivation
   paths* should change to reflect the new dependency graph.

   For fixed-output derivations, this returns a map from the name of
   each output to its hash, unique up to the output's contents.

   For regular derivations, it returns a single hash of the derivation
   ATerm, after subderivations have been likewise expunged from that
   derivation.
