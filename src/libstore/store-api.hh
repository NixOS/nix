/**
 * About the class hierarchy of the store implementations:
 *
 * Each store type `Foo` consists of two classes:
 *
 * 1. A class `FooConfig : virtual StoreConfig` that contains the configuration
 *   for the store
 *
 *   It should only contain members of type `const Setting<T>` (or subclasses
 *   of it) and inherit the constructors of `StoreConfig`
 *   (`using StoreConfig::StoreConfig`).
 *
 * 2. A class `Foo : virtual Store, virtual FooConfig` that contains the
 *   implementation of the store.
 *
 *   This class is expected to have a constructor `Foo(const Params & params)`
 *   that calls `StoreConfig(params)` (otherwise you're gonna encounter an
 *   `assertion failure` when trying to instantiate it).
 *
 * You can then register the new store using:
 *
 * ```
 * cpp static RegisterStoreImplementation<Foo, FooConfig> regStore;
 * ```

       would be calculated from writing this derivation to the store: it is OK

         - For the floating case in particular, it ensures that the derivation
           to output mapping respects the resolution equivalence relation, so
           one cannot choose different resolution-equivalent derivations to
           subvert dependency coherence (i.e. the property that one doesn't end
