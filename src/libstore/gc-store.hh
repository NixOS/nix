 *
 * Garbage collection will allow deleting paths which are not
 * transitively "rooted".
 *
 * The notion of GC roots actually not part of this class.
 *
 *  - The base `Store` class has `Store::addTempRoot()` because for a store
 *    that doesn't support garbage collection at all, a temporary GC root is
 *    safely implementable as no-op.
 *
 *    @todo actually this is not so good because stores are *views*.
 *    Some views have only a no-op temp roots even though others to the
 *    same store allow triggering GC. For instance one can't add a root
 *    over ssh, but that doesn't prevent someone from gc-ing that store
 *    accesed via SSH locally).
 *
 *  - The derived `LocalFSStore` class has `LocalFSStore::addPermRoot`,
 *    which is not part of this class because it relies on the notion of
 *    an ambient file system. There are stores (`ssh-ng://`, for one),
 *    that *do* support garbage collection but *don't* expose any file
 *    system, and `LocalFSStore::addPermRoot` thus does not make sense
 *    for them.
