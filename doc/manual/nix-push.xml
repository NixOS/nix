    <para>
      The command <command>nix-push</command> builds a set of store
      expressions (if necessary), and then packages and uploads all
      store paths in the resulting closures to a server.  A network
      cache thus populated can subsequently be used to speed up
      software deployment on other machines using the
      <command>nix-pull</command> command.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>nix-push</command> performs the following actions.
      
      <orderedlist>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            The store expressions stored in
            <replaceable>paths</replaceable> are realised (using
            <literal>nix-store --realise</literal>).
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            All paths in the closure of the store expressions stored
            in <replaceable>paths</replaceable> are determined (using
            <literal>nix-store --query --requisites
            --include-successors</literal>).  It should be noted that
            since the <option>--include-successors</option> flag is
            used, if you specify a derivation store expression, you
            get a combined source/binary distribution.  If you only
            want a binary distribution, you should specify the closure
            store expression that result from realising these (see
            below).
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            All store paths determined in the previous step are
            packaged and compressed into a <command>bzip</command>ped
            NAR archive (extension <filename>.nar.bz2</filename>).
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            A <emphasis>manifest</emphasis> is created that contains
            information on the store paths, their eventual URLs in the
            cache, and cryptographic hashes of the contents of the NAR
            archives.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Each store path is uploaded to the remote directory
            specified by <replaceable>archives-put-url</replaceable>.
            HTTP PUT requests are used to do this.  However, before a
            file <varname>x</varname> is uploaded to
            <literal><replaceable>archives-put-url</replaceable>/<varname>x</varname></literal>,
            <command>nix-push</command> first determines whether this
            upload is unnecessary by issuing a HTTP HEAD request on
            <literal><replaceable>archives-get-url</replaceable>/<varname>x</varname></literal>.
            This allows a cache to be shared between many partially
            overlapping <command>nix-push</command> invocations.
            (We use two URLs because the upload URL typically
            refers to a CGI script, while the download URL just refers
            to a file system directory on the server.)
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            The manifest is uploaded using an HTTP PUT request to
            <replaceable>manifest-put-url</replaceable>.  The
            corresponding URL to download the manifest can then be
            used by <command>nix-pull</command>.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        
      </orderedlist>
    </para>

    <title>Examples</title>

    <para>
      To upload files there typically is some CGI script on the server
      side.  This script should be be protected with a password.  The
      following example uploads the store paths resulting from
      building the Nix expressions in <filename>foo.nix</filename>,
      passing appropriate authentication information:
    
      <screen>
$ nix-push \
    http://foo@bar:server.domain/cgi-bin/upload.pl/cache \
    http://server.domain/cache \
    http://foo@bar:server.domain/cgi-bin/upload.pl/MANIFEST \
    $(nix-instantiate foo.nix)</screen>

    This will push both sources and binaries (and any build-time
    dependencies used in the build, such as compilers).
    </para>

    <para>
      If we just want to push binaries, not sources and build-time
      dependencies, we can do:
      
      <screen>
$ nix-push <replaceable>urls</replaceable> $(nix-instantiate $(nix-store -r foo.nix))</screen>
    
    </para>
