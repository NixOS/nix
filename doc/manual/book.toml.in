# Handles replacing @docroot@ with a path to ./source relative to that markdown file,
# {{#include handlebars}}, and the @generated@ syntax used within these. it mostly
# but not entirely replaces the links preprocessor (which we cannot simply use due
# to @generated@ files living in a different directory to make meson happy). we do
# not want to disable the links preprocessor entirely though because that requires
# disabling *all* built-in preprocessors and selectively reenabling those we want.
