# redirect rules for paths (server-side) to prevent link rot.
# see ./redirects.js for redirects based on URL fragments (client-side)
#
# concrete user story this supports:
# - user finds URL to the manual for Nix x.y
# - Nix x.z (z > y) is the most recent release
# - updating the version in the URL will show the right thing
#
# format documentation:
# - https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/#syntax-for-the-redirects-file
# - https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/
#
# conventions:
# - always force (<CODE>!) since this allows re-using file names
# - group related paths to ease readability
# - always append new redirects to the end of the file
# - redirects that should have been there but are missing can be inserted where they belong
