  <listitem>
    <para>The Nix expression evaluator is now much faster in most
    cases: typically, <link
    xlink:href="http://www.mail-archive.com/nix-dev@cs.uu.nl/msg04113.html">3
    to 8 times compared to the old implementation</link>.  It also
    uses less memory.  It no longer depends on the ATerm
    library.</para>

      Support for configurable parallelism inside builders.  Build
      scripts have always had the ability to perform multiple build
      actions in parallel (for instance, by running <command>make -j
      2</command>), but this was not desirable because the number of
      actions to be performed in parallel was not configurable.  Nix
      now has an option <option>--cores
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></option> as well as a configuration
      setting <varname>build-cores =
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></varname> that causes the
      environment variable <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar> to be set to
      <replaceable>N</replaceable> when the builder is invoked.  The
      builder can use this at its discretion to perform a parallel
      build, e.g., by calling <command>make -j
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></command>.  In Nixpkgs, this can be
      enabled on a per-package basis by setting the derivation
      attribute <varname>enableParallelBuilding</varname> to
      <literal>true</literal>.
