<title>Release 0.7 (January 12, 2005)</title>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>Binary patching.  When upgrading components using
  pre-built binaries (through nix-pull / nix-channel), Nix can
  automatically download and apply binary patches to already installed
  components instead of full downloads.  Patching is “smart”: if there
  is a <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> of patches to an installed
  component, Nix will use it.  Patches are currently generated
  automatically between Nixpkgs (pre-)releases.</para></listitem>

  mechanism.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Nix-pull now stores downloaded manifests in
  <filename>/nix/var/nix/manifests</filename>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Metadata on files in the Nix store is canonicalised
  after builds: the last-modified timestamp is set to 0 (00:00:00
  1/1/1970), the mode is set to 0444 or 0555 (readable and possibly
  executable by all; setuid/setgid bits are dropped), and the group is
  set to the default.  This ensures that the result of a build and an
  installation through a substitute is the same; and that timestamp
  dependencies are revealed.</para></listitem>
