The Rust-based rewrite of the Nix installer is now in beta.
We'd love help testing it out!

To test out the new installer, run:
```
curl -sSfL https://artifacts.nixos.org/nix-installer | sh -s -- install
```

This installer can be run even when you have an existing, script-based Nix installation without any adjustments.

This new installer also comes with the ability to uninstall your Nix installation; run:
```
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

This will get rid of your entire Nix installation (even if you installed over an existing, script-based installation).

This installer is a modified version of the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) by Determinate Systems.
Thanks to Determinate Systems for all the investment they've put into the installer.

Source for the installer is in https://github.com/NixOS/nix-installer.
Report any issues in that repo.

For CI usage, a GitHub Action to install Nix using this installer is available at https://github.com/NixOS/nix-installer-action.
