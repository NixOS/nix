synopsis: Derivation JSON format now uses store path basenames (no store dir) only

Experience with many JSON frameworks (e.g. nlohmann/json in C++, Serde in Rust, and Aeson in Haskell), has shown that the use of the store dir in JSON formats is an impediment to systematic JSON formats,
because it requires the serializer/deserializer to take an extra paramater (the store dir).

We ultimately want to rectify this issue with all (non-stable, able to be changed) JSON formats.
To start with, we are changing the JSON format for derivations because the `nix derivation` commands are
--- in addition to being formally unstable
--- less widely used than other unstable commands.

See the documentation on the [JSON format for derivations](@docroot@/protocols/json/derivation.md) for further details.
