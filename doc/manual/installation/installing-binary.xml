<title>Installing a Binary Distribution</title>

<para>If you are using Linux or macOS, the easiest way to install Nix
is to run the following command:

<screen>
  $ sh &lt;(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)
</screen>

As of Nix 2.1.0, the Nix installer will always default to creating a
single-user installation, however opting in to the multi-user
installation is highly recommended.
</para>

<section xml:id="sect-single-user-installation">
  <title>Single User Installation</title>

  <para>
    To explicitly select a single-user installation on your system:

    <screen>
  sh &lt;(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon
</screen>
  </para>

<para>
This will perform a single-user installation of Nix, meaning that
<filename>/nix</filename> is owned by the invoking user.  You should
run this under your usual user account, <emphasis>not</emphasis> as
root.  The script will invoke <command>sudo</command> to create
<filename>/nix</filename> if it doesn’t already exist.  If you don’t
have <command>sudo</command>, you should manually create
<command>/nix</command> first as root, e.g.:

<screen>
$ mkdir /nix
$ chown alice /nix
</screen>

The install script will modify the first writable file from amongst
<filename>.bash_profile</filename>, <filename>.bash_login</filename>
and <filename>.profile</filename> to source
<filename>~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</filename>. You can set
the <command>NIX_INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PROFILE</command> environment
variable before executing the install script to disable this
behaviour.
</para>


<para>You can uninstall Nix simply by running:

<screen>
$ rm -rf /nix
</screen>

</para>

<section xml:id="sect-multi-user-installation">
  <title>Multi User Installation</title>
  <para>
    The multi-user Nix installation creates system users, and a system
    service for the Nix daemon.

  <para>
    You can instruct the installer to perform a multi-user
    installation on your system:

    <screen>
  sh &lt;(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
</screen>
  </para>

  <para>
    The multi-user installation of Nix will create build users between
    the user IDs 30001 and 30032, and a group with the group ID 30000.

    You should run this under your usual user account,
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> as root. The script will invoke
    <command>sudo</command> as needed.
  </para>

  <note><para>
    If you need Nix to use a different group ID or user ID set, you
    will have to download the tarball manually and <link
    linkend="sect-nix-install-binary-tarball">edit the install
    script</link>.
  </para></note>

  <para>
    The installer will modify <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename>, and
    <filename>/etc/zshrc</filename> if they exist. The installer will
    first back up these files with a
    <literal>.backup-before-nix</literal> extension. The installer
    will also create <filename>/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>You can uninstall Nix with the following commands:

<screen>
sudo rm -rf /etc/profile/nix.sh /etc/nix /nix ~root/.nix-profile ~root/.nix-defexpr ~root/.nix-channels ~/.nix-profile ~/.nix-defexpr ~/.nix-channels

# If you are on Linux with systemd, you will need to run:
sudo systemctl stop nix-daemon.socket
sudo systemctl stop nix-daemon.service
sudo systemctl disable nix-daemon.socket
sudo systemctl disable nix-daemon.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# If you are on macOS, you will need to run:
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.nix-daemon.plist
sudo rm /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.nix-daemon.plist
</screen>

    There may also be references to Nix in
    <filename>/etc/profile</filename>,
    <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename>, and
    <filename>/etc/zshrc</filename> which you may remove.

  <title>APFS Volume Installation</title>

  <para>
    The root filesystem is read-only as of macOS 10.15 Catalina, all writable
    paths were moved to a separate data volume.  This means creating or writing
    to <filename>/nix</filename> is not allowed.  While changing the default prefix
    would be possible, it's a very intrusive change that has side effects we want to
    avoid for now.
  </para>

  <para>
    For common writable locations <literal>firmlinks</literal> were introduced,
    described by Apple as a "bi-directional wormhole" between two filesystems.
    Essentially a bind mount for APFS volumes.  However this is (currently) not
    user configurable and only available for paths like <filename>/Users</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
    For special cases like NFS mount points or package manager roots <link xlink:href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man5/synthetic.conf.5.html">synthetic.conf(5)</link>
    provides a mechanism for some limited, user-controlled file-creation at <filename>/</filename>.
    This only applies at boot time, however <command>apfs.util</command> can be used
    to trigger the creation (not deletion) of new entries without a reboot.
    It would be ideal if this could create firmlinks, however a symlink or mountpoint
    are the only options.
  </para>

<screen>
alice$ /System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs.util -B
</screen>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The simplest solution is creating a symlink with <filename>/etc/synthetic.conf</filename>
        to the data volume. (not recommended)
      </para>

<screen>
nix    /System/Volumes/Data/nix
</screen>

<screen>
alice$ ls -l /
lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  wheel    25 Jan  1  2019 nix -> /System/Volumes/Data/nix
</screen>

      <para>
        However builds that detect or resolve this symlink will leak the canonical
        location or even fail in certain cases, making this approach undesirable.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        An empty directory can also be created using <filename>/etc/synthetic.conf</filename>,
        this won't be writable but can be used as a mount point.  And with
        <literal>APFS</literal> it's relatively easy to create an separate
        volume for nix instead.
      </para>

<screen>
nix
</screen>

<screen>
alice$ /System/Library/Filesystems/apfs.fs/Contents/Resources/apfs.util -B
alice$ sudo diskutil apfs addVolume diskX APFS 'Nix Store' -mountpoint /nix
alice$ mount
/dev/disk1s6 on /nix (apfs, local, journaled)
</screen>

      <para>
        This does make the installation more complicated, requiring both
        <filename>/etc/synthetic.conf</filename> as well as <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>
      </para>

      <para>
        On macOS volumes are also mounted quite late, launchd services or other
        things that start during login will start before our volume is mounted.
        For these cases eg. <command>wait4path</command> must be used for
        things that depend on <filename>/nix</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
        This new volume also won't be encrypted by default, and enabling is
        only possible interactively?

    These install scripts can be used the same as the main

  <title>Installing from a binary tarball</title>

  <para>
    You can also download a binary tarball that contains Nix and all
    its dependencies.  (This is what the install script at
    <uri>https://nixos.org/nix/install</uri> does automatically.)  You
    should unpack it somewhere (e.g. in <filename>/tmp</filename>),
    and then run the script named <command>install</command> inside
    the binary tarball:


<screen>
alice$ cd /tmp
alice$ tar xfj nix-1.8-x86_64-darwin.tar.bz2
alice$ cd nix-1.8-x86_64-darwin
alice$ ./install

  <para>
    If you need to edit the multi-user installation script to use
    different group ID or a different user ID range, modify the
    variables set in the file named
    <filename>install-multi-user</filename>.
