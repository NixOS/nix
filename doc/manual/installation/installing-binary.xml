<title>Installing a Binary Distribution</title>

<para>The easiest way to install Nix is to run the following command:

<screen>
$ bash &lt;(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)
</screen>

This will perform a single-user installation of Nix, meaning that
<filename>/nix</filename> is owned by the invoking user.  You should
run this under your usual user account, <emphasis>not</emphasis> as
root.  The script will invoke <command>sudo</command> to create
<filename>/nix</filename> if it doesn’t already exist.  If you don’t
have <command>sudo</command>, you should manually create
<command>/nix</command> first as root:

<screen>
$ mkdir /nix
$ chown alice /nix
</screen>

</para>

<para>You can also manually download and install a binary package.
Binary packages of the latest stable release are available for Fedora,
Debian, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and various other systems from the <link
xlink:href="http://nixos.org/nix/download.html">Nix homepage</link>.
You can also get builds of the latest development release from our
<link
xlink:href="http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nix/master/release/latest-finished#tabs-constituents">continuous
build system</link>.</para>

<para>For Fedora, RPM packages are available.  These can be installed
or upgraded using <command>rpm -U</command>.  For example,

<screen>
$ rpm -U nix-1.7-1.i386.rpm</screen>

</para>

<para>For Debian and Ubuntu, you can download a Deb package and
install it like this:

<screen>
$ dpkg -i nix_1.7-1_amd64.deb</screen>

</para>

<para>For other platforms, including Mac OS X (Darwin), FreeBSD and
other Linux distributions, you can download a binary tarball that
contains Nix and all its dependencies.  (This is what the install
script at <uri>https://nixos.org/nix/install</uri> uses.)  You should
unpack it somewhere (e.g. in <filename>/tmp</filename>), and then run
the script named <command>install</command> inside the binary tarball:

<screen>
alice$ cd /tmp
alice$ tar xfj nix-1.7-x86_64-darwin.tar.bz2
alice$ cd nix-1.7-x86_64-darwin
alice$ ./install
</screen>

</para>

<para>Nix can be uninstalled using <command>rpm -e nix</command> or
<command>dpkg -r nix</command> on RPM- and Dpkg-based systems,
respectively.  After this you should manually remove the Nix store and
other auxiliary data, if desired:

<screen>
$ rm -rf /nix</screen>

</para>
