<title>Sharing Packages Between Machines</title>

<para>Sometimes you want to copy a package from one machine to
another.  Or, you want to install some packages and you know that
another machine already has some or all of those packages or their
dependencies.  In that case there are mechanisms to quickly copy
packages between machines.</para>

<para>For the following to work you need to create a pair of RSA
keys on the involved computers. These keys can be generated with
openssl (or libressl) via

<screen>
$ openssl genrsa -out /etc/nix/signing-key.sec 4096
$ openssl rsa -in /etc/nix/signing-key.sec -pubout > /etc/nix/signing-key.pub
</screen>

The keys should be owned by root and have the following
permissions

<screen>
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  800 Mar 11 11:09 signing-key.pub
-r--------  1 root root 3.2K Mar 11 11:09 signing-key.sec 
</screen>

Make sure to copy these keys, once generated, to the other computer
and set the correct owner / permissions.
