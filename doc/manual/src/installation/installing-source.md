# Installing Nix from Source

If no binary package is available or if you want to hack on Nix, you
can build Nix from its Git repository.

> PR_COMMENT This section feels incomplete: it gets to a point of how to build Nix, but it never brings up the topic of single-user and multi-user. I know that if one does everything by themselves then they can set up their system in a way that is not as black and white, but it would be nice to mention that after simply building Nix, one effectively has a single-user install (I think). At least, if someone reads that section to learn, they could use the previously learned terminologies (i.e., single-user & multi-user) as mental anchors.
