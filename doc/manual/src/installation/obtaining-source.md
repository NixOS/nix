# Obtaining a Source Distribution

The source tarball of the most recent stable release can be downloaded
from the [Nix homepage](http://nixos.org/nix/download.html). You can
also grab the [most recent development
release](http://hydra.nixos.org/job/nix/master/release/latest-finished#tabs-constituents).

Alternatively, the most recent sources of Nix can be obtained from its
[Git repository](https://github.com/NixOS/nix). For example, the
following command will check out the latest revision into a directory
called `nix`:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nix
```

Likewise, specific releases can be obtained from the
[tags](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/tags) of the repository.
