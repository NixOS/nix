# Release X.Y (202?-??-??)

- Two new builtin functions,
  [`builtins.parseFlakeRef`](@docroot@/language/builtins.md#builtins-parseFlakeRef)
  and
  [`builtins.flakeRefToString`](@docroot@/language/builtins.md#builtins-flakeRefToString),
  have been added.
  These functions are useful for converting between flake references encoded as attribute sets and URLs.
