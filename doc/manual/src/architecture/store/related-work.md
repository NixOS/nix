## Lazy evaluation

We clearly have thunks that produce thunks, but less clearly functions that produce functions.

Do we have open terms?

Do we hve thunks vs expressions distinction?

## Comparison with Git file system model

This is close to Git's model, but with one crucial difference:
Git puts the "permission" info within the directory map's values instead of making it part of the file (blob, in it's parlance) object.

```idris
data GitObject
  = Blob ByteString
  | Tree (Map FileName (Persission, FSO))

data Persission
  = Directory -- IFF paired with tree
  -- Iff paired with blob, one of:
  | RegFile
  | ExecutableFile
  | Symlink
```

So long as the root object is a directory, the representations are isomorphic.
There is no "wiggle room" the git way since whenever the permission info wouldn't matter (e.g. the child object being mapped to is a directory), the permission info must be a sentinel value.

However, if the root object is a blob, there is loss of fidelity.
Since the permission info is used to distinguish executable files, non-executable files, and symlinks, but there isn't a "parent" directory of the root to contain that info, these 3 cases cannot be distinguished.

Git's model matches Unix tradition, but Nix's model is more natural.

## Machine models

Derivations as store objects via drv files makes Nix a "Von Neumann" architecture.
Can also imagine a "Harvard" architecture where derivations are stored separately?
Can we in general imagine N heaps for N different sorts of objects?
See note in the section on [abstract derivations and derived paths](./abstract/drv.md).

TODO
Also, leaning on the notion of "builtin builders" more, having multiple different sorts of user-defined builders too.
The builder is a black box as far as the Nix model is concerned.
