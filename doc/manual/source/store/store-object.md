## Store Object

A Nix store is a collection of *store objects* with *references* between them.
A store object consists of

  - A [file system object](./file-system-object.md) as data

  - A set of [store paths](./store-path.md) as references to store objects

### References

Store objects can refer to both other store objects and themselves.
References from a store object to itself are called *self-references*.

Store objects and their references form a directed graph, where the store objects are the vertices, and the references are the edges.
In particular, the edge corresponding to a reference is from the store object that contains the reference, and to the store object that the store path (which is the reference) refers to.

References other than a self-reference must not form a cycle.
The graph of references excluding self-references thus forms a [directed acyclic graph].

We can take the [transitive closure] of the references graph, which any pair of store objects have an edge not if there is a single reference from the first to the second, but a path of one or more references from the first to the second.
The *requisites* of a store object are all store objects reachable by paths of references which start with given store object's references.

We can also take the [transpose graph] ofthe references graph, where we reverse the orientation of all edges.
The *referrers* of a store object are the store objects that reference it.

One can also combine both concepts: taking the transitive closure of the transposed references graph.
The *referrers closure* of a store object are the store objects that can reach the given store object via paths of references.

    Regardless of what store contains the store object in question, and what else that store may or may not contain, the references are the same.

> Exactly what store object is being referenced, and what in turn *its* references are, depends on the store in question.

> - The referrers of a store object are completely extrinsic, and depends solely on the store which contains that store object, not the store object itself.
>   Other store objects which refer to the store object in question may be added or removed from the store.

### Immutability

Store objects are [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object):
Once created, they do not change nor can any store object they reference be changed.

> **Note**
>
> Stores which support atomically deleting multiple store objects allow more flexibility while still upholding this property.

### Closure property

A store can only contain a store object if it also contains all the store objects it refers to.

> **Note**
>
> The "closure property" isn't meant to prohibit, for example, [lazy loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading) of store objects.
> However, the "closure property" and immutability in conjunction imply that any such lazy loading ought to be deterministic.
