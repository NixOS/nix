# Input-addressing derivation outputs

[input addressing]: #input-addressing

"Input addressing" means the address the store object by the *way it was made* rather than *what it is*.
That is to say, an input-addressed output's store path is a function not of the output itself, but of the derivation that produced it.
Even if two store paths have the same contents, if they are produced in different ways, and one is input-addressed, then they will have different store paths, and thus guaranteed to not be the same store object.

## Modulo content addressed derivation outputs {#hash-quotient-drv}

So how do we compute the hash part of the output paths of an input-addressed derivation?
This is done by the function `hashQuotientDerivation`, shown below.

First, a word on inputs.
`hashQuotientDerivation` is only defined on derivations whose [inputs](@docroot@/store/derivation/index.md#inputs) take the first-order form:
```typescript
type ConstantPath = {
  path: StorePath;
};

type FirstOrderOutputPath = {
  drvPath: StorePath;
  output: OutputName;
};

type FirstOrderDerivingPath = ConstantPath | FirstOrderOutputPath;

type Inputs = Set<FirstOrderDerivingPath>;
```

For the the algorithm below, we adopt a derivation where the two types of (first order) derived paths are partitioned into two sets, as follows:
```typescript
type Derivation = {
  // inputs: Set<FirstOrderDerivingPath>; // replaced
  inputSrcs: Set<ConstantPath>; // new instead
  inputDrvOutputs: Set<FirstOrderOutputPath>; // new instead
  // ...other fields...
};
```

In the [currently-experimental][xp-feature-dynamic-derivations] higher-order case where outputs of outputs are allowed as [deriving paths][deriving-path] and thus derivation inputs, derivations using that generalization are not valid arguments to this function.
Those derivations must be (partially) [resolved](@docroot@/store/resolution.md) enough first, to the point where no such higher-order inputs remain.
Then, and only then, can input addresses be assigned.

```
function hashQuotientDerivation(drv) -> Hash:
    assert(drv.outputs are input-addressed)
    drv′ ← drv with {
        inputDrvOutputs = ⋃(
            assert(drvPath is store path)
            case hashOutputsOrQuotientDerivation(readDrv(drvPath)) of
                drvHash : Hash →
                    (drvHash.toBase16(), output)
                outputHashes : Map[String, Hash] →
                    (outputHashes[output].toBase16(), "out")
            | (drvPath, output) ∈ drv.inputDrvOutputs
        )
    }
    return hashSHA256(printDrv(drv′))

function hashOutputsOrQuotientDerivation(drv) -> Map[String, Hash] | Hash:
    if drv.outputs are content-addressed:
        return {
            outputName ↦ hashSHA256(
                "fixed:out:" + ca.printMethodAlgo() +
                ":" + ca.hash.toBase16() +
                ":" + ca.makeFixedOutputPath(drv.name, outputName))
            | (outputName ↦ output) ∈ drv.outputs
            , ca = output.contentAddress // or get from build trace if floating
        }
    else: // drv.outputs are input-addressed
        return hashQuotientDerivation(drv)
```

### `hashQuotientDerivation`

We replace each element in the derivation's `inputDrvOutputs` using data from a call to `hashOutputsOrQuotientDerivation` on the `drvPath` of that element.
When `hashOutputsOrQuotientDerivation` returns a single drv hash (because the input derivation in question is input-addressing), we simply swap out the `drvPath` for that hash, and keep the same output name.
When `hashOutputsOrQuotientDerivation` returns a map of content addresses per per-output, we look up the output in question, and pair it with the output name `out`.

The resulting pseudo-derivation (with hashes instead of store paths in `inputDrvs`) is then printed (in the ["ATerm" format](@docroot@/protocols/derivation-aterm.md)) and hashes, and this becomes the hash of the "quotient derivation".

When calculating output hashes, `hashQuotientDerivation` is called on an almost-complete input-addressing derivation, which is just missing its input-addressed outputs paths.
The derivation hash is then used to calculate output paths for each output.
<!-- TODO describe how this is done. -->
Those output paths can then be substituted into the almost-complete input-addressed derivation to complete it.

> Once this bug is fixed, this note will be removed.

### `hashOutputsOrQuotientDerivation`

How does `hashOutputsOrQuotientDerivation` in turn work?
It consists of two main cases, based on whether the outputs of the derivation are to be input-addressed or content-addressed.

#### Input-addressed outputs case

In the input-addressed case, it just calls `hashQuotientDerivation`, and returns that derivation hash.
This makes `hashQuotientDerivation` and `hashOutputsOrQuotientDerivation` mutually-recursive.

> **Note**
>
> In this case, `hashQuotientDerivation` is being called on a *complete* input-addressing derivation that already has its output paths calculated.
> The `inputDrvs` substitution takes place anyways.

#### Content-addressed outputs case

If the outputs are [content-addressed](./content-address.md), then it computes a hash for each output derived from the content-address of that output.

> **Note**
>
> In the [fixed](./content-address.md#fixed) content-addressing case, the outputs' content addresses are statically specified in advanced, so this always just works.
> (The fixed case is what the pseudo-code shows.)
>
> In the [floating](./content-address.md#floating) case, the content addresses are not specified in advanced.
> This is what the "or get from [build trace](@docroot@/store/build-trace.md) if floating" comment refers to.
> In this case, the algorithm is *stuck* until the input in question is built, and we know what the actual contents of the output in question is.
>
> That is OK however, because there is no problem with delaying the assigning of input addresses (which, remember, is what `hashQuotientDerivation` is ultimately for) until all inputs are known.

### Performance

The recursion in the algorithm is potentially inefficient:
it could call itself once for each path by which a subderivation can be reached, i.e., `O(V^k)` times for a derivation graph with `V` derivations and with out-degree of at most `k`.
In the actual implementation, memoisation is used to reduce this to `O(V + E)` complexity for a graph with `E` edges.

### Semantic properties

In essence, `hashQuotientDerivation` partitions input-addressing derivations into equivalence classes: every derivation in that equivalence class is mapped to the same derivation hash.
We can characterize this equivalence relation directly, by working bottom up.

We start by defining an equivalence relation on first-order output deriving paths that refer content-addressed derivation outputs. Two such paths are equivalent if they refer to the same store object:

\\[
\\begin{prooftree}
\\AxiomC{$d\_1$ is content-addressing}
\\AxiomC{$d\_2$ is content-addressing}
\\AxiomC{${}^\*(d\_1, o\_1) = {}^\*(d\_2, o\_2)$}
\\TrinaryInfC{$(d\_1, o\_1) \\,\\sim_{\\mathrm{CA}}\\, (d\_2, o\_2)$}
\\end{prooftree}
\\]

where \\({}^*(d, o)\\) denotes the store object that the output deriving path refers to.

We will also need the following construction to lift any equivalence relation on \\(X\\) to an equivalence relation on (finite) sets of \\(X\\) (in short, \\(\\mathcal{P}(X)\\)):

\\[
\\begin{prooftree}
\\AxiomC{$\\forall a \\in A. \\exists b \\in B. a \\,\\sim\_X\\, b$}
\\AxiomC{$\\forall b \\in B. \\exists a \\in A. b \\,\\sim\_X\\, a$}
\\BinaryInfC{$A \\,\\sim_{\\mathcal{P}(X)}\\, B$}
\\end{prooftree}
\\]

Now we can define the equivalence relation \\(\\sim_\\mathrm{IA}\\) on input-addressed derivation outputs. Two input-addressed outputs are equivalent if their derivations are equivalent (via the yet-to-be-defined \\(\\sim_{\\mathrm{IADrv}}\\) relation) and their output names are the same:

\\[
\\begin{prooftree}
\\AxiomC{$d\_1$ is input-addressing}
\\AxiomC{$d\_2$ is input-addressing}
\\AxiomC{$d\_1 \\,\\sim_{\\mathrm{IADrv}}\\, d\_2$}
\\AxiomC{$o\_1 = o\_2$}
\\QuaternaryInfC{$(d\_1, o\_1) \\,\\sim_{\\mathrm{IA}}\\, (d\_2, o\_2)$}
\\end{prooftree}
\\]

And now we can define \\(\\sim_{\\mathrm{IADrv}}\\).
Two input-addressed derivations are equivalent if their content-addressed inputs are equivalent, their input-addressed inputs are also equivalent, and they are otherwise equal:

\\[
\\begin{prooftree}
\\AxiomC{$
  \\mathrm{caInputs}(d\_1)
  \\,\\sim_{\\mathcal{P}(\\mathrm{CA})}\\,
  \\mathrm{caInputs}(d\_2)
$}
\\AxiomC{$
  \\mathrm{iaInputs}(d\_1)
  \\,\\sim_{\\mathcal{P}(\\mathrm{IA})}\\,
  \\mathrm{iaInputs}(d\_2)
$}
\\AxiomC{$
  d\_1\left[\\mathrm{inputDrvOutputs} := \\{\\}\right]
  \=
  d\_2\left[\\mathrm{inputDrvOutputs} := \\{\\}\right]
$}
\\TrinaryInfC{$d\_1 \\,\\sim_{\\mathrm{IADrv}}\\, d\_2$}
\\end{prooftree}
\\]

where \\(\\mathrm{caInputs}(d)\\) returns the content-addressed inputs of \\(d\\) and \\(\\mathrm{iaInputs}(d)\\) returns the input-addressed inputs.

> An astute reader might notice that that nowhere does `inputSrcs` enter into these definitions.
> That means that replacing an input derivation with its outputs directly added to `inputSrcs` always results in a derivation in a different equivalence class, despite the resulting input closure (as would be mounted in the store at build time) being the same.
> [Issue #9259](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/9259) is about creating a coarser equivalence relation to address this.
