title: Derivation
description: |
  Experimental JSON representation of a Nix derivation (version 3).

  This schema describes the JSON representation of Nix's `Derivation` type.

  > **Warning**

  > This JSON format is currently
  > [**experimental**](@docroot@/development/experimental-features.md#xp-feature-nix-command)
  > and subject to change.

    type: string
    title: Derivation name
    description: |
      The name of the derivation.
      Used when calculating store paths for the derivation’s outputs.

  version:
    const: 3
    title: Format version (must be 3)
    description: |
      Must be `3`.
      This is a guard that allows us to continue evolving this format.
      The choice of `3` is fairly arbitrary, but corresponds to this informal version:

      - Version 0: A-Term format

      - Version 1: Original JSON format, with ugly `"r:sha256"` inherited from A-Term format.

      - Version 2: Separate `method` and `hashAlgo` fields in output specs

      - Version 3: Drop store dir from store paths, just include base name.

      Note that while this format is experimental, the maintenance of versions is best-effort, and not promised to identify every change.

  outputs:
    type: object
    title: Output specifications
    description: |
     Information about the output paths of the derivation.
     This is a JSON object with one member per output, where the key is the output name and the value is a JSON object as described.

      > **Example**
      >
      > ```json
      > "outputs": {
      >   "out": {
      >     "method": "nar",
      >     "hashAlgo": "sha256",
