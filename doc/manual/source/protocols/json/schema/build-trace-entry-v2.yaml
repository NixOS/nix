title: Build Trace Entry
description: |
  A record of a successful build outcome for a specific derivation output.

  This schema describes the JSON representation of a [build trace entry](@docroot@/store/build-trace.md).

  > **Warning**
  >
  > This JSON format is currently
  > [**experimental**](@docroot@/development/experimental-features.md#xp-feature-ca-derivations)
  > and subject to change.

          Unique identifier for the derivation output that was built.

          Format: `{hash-quotient-drv}!{output-name}`

          - **hash-quotient-drv**: SHA-256 [hash of the quotient derivation](@docroot@/store/derivation/outputs/input-address.md#hash-quotient-drv).
            Begins with `sha256:`.

          - **output-name**: Name of the specific output (e.g., "out", "dev", "doc")

          Example: `"sha256:ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad!foo"`
