<title>Customizing the Generic Builder</title>

<para>The operation of the generic builder can be modified in many
places by setting certain variables.  These <emphasis>hook
variables</emphasis> are typically set to the name of some shell
function defined by you.  For instance, to perform some additional
steps after <command>make install</command> you would set the
<varname>postInstall</varname> variable:

<programlisting>
postInstall=myPostInstall

myPostInstall() {
    mkdir $out/share/extra
    cp extrafiles/* $out/share/extra
}</programlisting>

</para>
