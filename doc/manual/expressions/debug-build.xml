<title>Debugging Build Failures</title>

<para>At the beginning of each phase, the set of all shell variables
is written to the file <filename>env-vars</filename> at the top-level
build directory.  This is useful for debugging: it allows you to
recreate the environment in which a build was performed.  For
instance, if a build fails, then assuming you used the
<option>-K</option> flag, you can go to the output directory and
<quote>switch</quote> to the environment of the builder:

<screen>
$ nix-build -K ./foo.nix
... fails, keeping build directory `/tmp/nix-1234-0'

$ cd /tmp/nix-1234-0

$ source env-vars

<lineannotation>(edit some files...)</lineannotation>

$ make

<lineannotation>(execution continues with the same GCC, make, etc.)</lineannotation></screen>

</para>
