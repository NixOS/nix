<title>Introduction</title>

<chapter xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" version="5.0" xml:id="ch-about-nix">

<title>About Nix</title>

<para>Nix is a <emphasis>purely functional package manager</emphasis>.
This means that it treats packages like values in purely functional
programming languages such as Haskell &#x2014; they are built by functions
that don&#x2019;t have side-effects, and they never change after they have
been built.  Nix stores packages in the <emphasis>Nix
store</emphasis>, usually the directory
<filename>/nix/store</filename>, where each package has its own unique
subdirectory such as

<programlisting>
/nix/store/b6gvzjyb2pg0kjfwrjmg1vfhh54ad73z-firefox-33.1/
</programlisting>

where <literal>b6gvzjyb2pg0&#x2026;</literal> is a unique identifier for the
package that captures all its dependencies (it&#x2019;s a cryptographic hash
of the package&#x2019;s build dependency graph).  This enables many powerful
features.</para>


<simplesect><title>Multiple versions</title>

<para>You can have multiple versions or variants of a package
installed at the same time.  This is especially important when
different applications have dependencies on different versions of the
same package &#x2014; it prevents the &#x201C;DLL hell&#x201D;.  Because of the hashing
scheme, different versions of a package end up in different paths in
the Nix store, so they don&#x2019;t interfere with each other.</para>

<para>An important consequence is that operations like upgrading or
uninstalling an application cannot break other applications, since
these operations never &#x201C;destructively&#x201D; update or delete files that are
used by other packages.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Complete dependencies</title>

<para>Nix helps you make sure that package dependency specifications
are complete.  In general, when you&#x2019;re making a package for a package
management system like RPM, you have to specify for each package what
its dependencies are, but there are no guarantees that this
specification is complete.  If you forget a dependency, then the
package will build and work correctly on <emphasis>your</emphasis>
machine if you have the dependency installed, but not on the end
user's machine if it's not there.</para>

<para>Since Nix on the other hand doesn&#x2019;t install packages in &#x201C;global&#x201D;
locations like <filename>/usr/bin</filename> but in package-specific
directories, the risk of incomplete dependencies is greatly reduced.
This is because tools such as compilers don&#x2019;t search in per-packages
directories such as
<filename>/nix/store/5lbfaxb722zp&#x2026;-openssl-0.9.8d/include</filename>,
so if a package builds correctly on your system, this is because you
specified the dependency explicitly. This takes care of the build-time
dependencies.</para>

<para>Once a package is built, runtime dependencies are found by
scanning binaries for the hash parts of Nix store paths (such as
<literal>r8vvq9kq&#x2026;</literal>).  This sounds risky, but it works
extremely well.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Multi-user support</title>

<para>Nix has multi-user support.  This means that non-privileged
users can securely install software.  Each user can have a different
<emphasis>profile</emphasis>, a set of packages in the Nix store that
appear in the user&#x2019;s <envar>PATH</envar>.  If a user installs a
package that another user has already installed previously, the
package won&#x2019;t be built or downloaded a second time.  At the same time,
it is not possible for one user to inject a Trojan horse into a
package that might be used by another user.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Atomic upgrades and rollbacks</title>

<para>Since package management operations never overwrite packages in
the Nix store but just add new versions in different paths, they are
<emphasis>atomic</emphasis>.  So during a package upgrade, there is no
time window in which the package has some files from the old version
and some files from the new version &#x2014; which would be bad because a
program might well crash if it&#x2019;s started during that period.</para>

<para>And since packages aren&#x2019;t overwritten, the old versions are still
there after an upgrade.  This means that you can <emphasis>roll
back</emphasis> to the old version:</para>

<screen>
$ nix-env --upgrade <replaceable>some-packages</replaceable>
$ nix-env --rollback
</screen>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Garbage collection</title>

<para>When you uninstall a package like this&#x2026;

<screen>
$ nix-env --uninstall firefox
</screen>

the package isn&#x2019;t deleted from the system right away (after all, you
might want to do a rollback, or it might be in the profiles of other
users).  Instead, unused packages can be deleted safely by running the
<emphasis>garbage collector</emphasis>:

<screen>
$ nix-collect-garbage
</screen>

This deletes all packages that aren&#x2019;t in use by any user profile or by
a currently running program.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Functional package language</title>

<para>Packages are built from <emphasis>Nix expressions</emphasis>,
which is a simple functional language.  A Nix expression describes
everything that goes into a package build action (a &#x201C;derivation&#x201D;):
other packages, sources, the build script, environment variables for
the build script, etc.  Nix tries very hard to ensure that Nix
expressions are <emphasis>deterministic</emphasis>: building a Nix
expression twice should yield the same result.</para>

<para>Because it&#x2019;s a functional language, it&#x2019;s easy to support
building variants of a package: turn the Nix expression into a
function and call it any number of times with the appropriate
arguments.  Due to the hashing scheme, variants don&#x2019;t conflict with
each other in the Nix store.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Transparent source/binary deployment</title>

<para>Nix expressions generally describe how to build a package from
source, so an installation action like

<screen>
$ nix-env --install firefox
</screen>

<emphasis>could</emphasis> cause quite a bit of build activity, as not
only Firefox but also all its dependencies (all the way up to the C
library and the compiler) would have to built, at least if they are
not already in the Nix store.  This is a <emphasis>source deployment
model</emphasis>.  For most users, building from source is not very
pleasant as it takes far too long.  However, Nix can automatically
skip building from source and instead use a <emphasis>binary
cache</emphasis>, a web server that provides pre-built binaries. For
instance, when asked to build
<literal>/nix/store/b6gvzjyb2pg0&#x2026;-firefox-33.1</literal> from source,
Nix would first check if the file
<uri>https://cache.nixos.org/b6gvzjyb2pg0&#x2026;.narinfo</uri> exists, and
if so, fetch the pre-built binary referenced from there; otherwise, it
would fall back to building from source.</para>

</simplesect>


<!--
<simplesect><title>Binary patching</title>

<para>In addition to downloading binaries automatically if they’re
available, Nix can download binary deltas that patch an existing
package in the Nix store into a new version.  This speeds up
upgrades.</para>

</simplesect>
-->


<simplesect><title>Nix Packages collection</title>

<para>We provide a large set of Nix expressions containing hundreds of
existing Unix packages, the <emphasis>Nix Packages
collection</emphasis> (Nixpkgs).</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Managing build environments</title>

<para>Nix is extremely useful for developers as it makes it easy to
automatically set up the build environment for a package. Given a
Nix expression that describes the dependencies of your package, the
command <command>nix-shell</command> will build or download those
dependencies if they&#x2019;re not already in your Nix store, and then start
a Bash shell in which all necessary environment variables (such as
compiler search paths) are set.</para>

<para>For example, the following command gets all dependencies of the
Pan newsreader, as described by <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/networking/newsreaders/pan/default.nix">its
Nix expression</link>:</para>

<screen>
$ nix-shell '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' -A pan
</screen>

<para>You&#x2019;re then dropped into a shell where you can edit, build and test
the package:</para>

<screen>
[nix-shell]$ tar xf $src
[nix-shell]$ cd pan-*
[nix-shell]$ ./configure
[nix-shell]$ make
[nix-shell]$ ./pan/gui/pan
</screen>

<!--
<para>Since Nix packages are reproducible and have complete dependency
specifications, Nix makes an excellent basis for <a
href="[%root%]hydra">a continuous build system</a>.</para>
-->

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Portability</title>

<para>Nix runs on Linux and macOS.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>NixOS</title>

<para>NixOS is a Linux distribution based on Nix.  It uses Nix not
just for package management but also to manage the system
configuration (e.g., to build configuration files in
<filename>/etc</filename>).  This means, among other things, that it
is easy to roll back the entire configuration of the system to an
earlier state.  Also, users can install software without root
privileges.  For more information and downloads, see the <link xlink:href="http://nixos.org/">NixOS homepage</link>.</para>

<simplesect><title>License</title>

<para>Nix is released under the terms of the <link xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html">GNU
LGPLv2.1 or (at your option) any later version</link>.</para>

<procedure>

<step><para>Install single-user Nix by running the following:

<screen>
$ bash &lt;(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
</screen>

This will install Nix in <filename>/nix</filename>. The install script
will create <filename>/nix</filename> using <command>sudo</command>,
so make sure you have sufficient rights.  (For other installation
methods, see <xref linkend="chap-installation"/>.)</para></step>

<step><para>See what installable packages are currently available
in the channel:

<screen>
$ nix-env -qa
docbook-xml-4.3
docbook-xml-4.5
firefox-33.0.2
hello-2.9
libxslt-1.1.28
<replaceable>...</replaceable></screen>

</para></step>

<step><para>Install some packages from the channel:

<screen>
$ nix-env -i hello</screen>

This should download pre-built packages; it should not build them
locally (if it does, something went wrong).</para></step>

<step><para>Test that they work:

<screen>
$ which hello
/home/eelco/.nix-profile/bin/hello
$ hello
Hello, world!
</screen>

</para></step>

<step><para>Uninstall a package:

<screen>
$ nix-env -e hello</screen>

</para></step>

<step><para>You can also test a package without installing it:

<screen>
$ nix-shell -p hello
</screen>

This builds or downloads GNU Hello and its dependencies, then drops
you into a Bash shell where the <command>hello</command> command is
present, all without affecting your normal environment:

<screen>
[nix-shell:~]$ hello
Hello, world!

[nix-shell:~]$ exit

$ hello
hello: command not found
</screen>

</para></step>

<step><para>To keep up-to-date with the channel, do:

<screen>
$ nix-channel --update nixpkgs
$ nix-env -u '*'</screen>

The latter command will upgrade each installed package for which there
is a &#x201C;newer&#x201D; version (as determined by comparing the version
numbers).</para></step>

<step><para>If you're unhappy with the result of a
<command>nix-env</command> action (e.g., an upgraded package turned
out not to work properly), you can go back:

<screen>
$ nix-env --rollback</screen>

</para></step>

<step><para>You should periodically run the Nix garbage collector
to get rid of unused packages, since uninstalls or upgrades don't
actually delete them:

<screen>
$ nix-collect-garbage -d</screen>

<!--
The first command deletes old “generations” of your profile (making
rollbacks impossible, but also making the packages in those old
generations available for garbage collection), while the second
command actually deletes them.-->

  If you are using Linux or macOS versions up to 10.14 (Mojave), the

<para>
This will perform a single-user installation of Nix, meaning that
<filename>/nix</filename> is owned by the invoking user.  You should

<filename>/nix</filename> if it doesn&#x2019;t already exist.  If you don&#x2019;t
have <command>sudo</command>, you should manually create
<filename>/nix</filename> first as root, e.g.:

<screen>
$ mkdir /nix
$ chown alice /nix
</screen>

The install script will modify the first writable file from amongst
<filename>.bash_profile</filename>, <filename>.bash_login</filename>
and <filename>.profile</filename> to source
<filename>~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</filename>. You can set
the <envar>NIX_INSTALLER_NO_MODIFY_PROFILE</envar> environment

    With all separate-volume approaches, it's possible something on

      Changing the default prefix for the Nix store is a simple
      approach which enables you to leave it on your root volume,
      where it can take full advantage of FileVault encryption if
      enabled. Unfortunately, this approach also opts your device out

            spend more time waiting for builds.

    <title>Use a separate encrypted volume</title>
    <para>
      If you like, you can also add encryption to the recommended
      approach taken by the installer. You can do this by pre-creating
      an encrypted volume before you run the installer--or you can
      run the installer and encrypt the volume it creates later.
      <!-- TODO: see later note about whether this needs both add-encryption and from-scratch directions -->
    </para>
    <para>
      In either case, adding encryption to a second volume isn't quite
      as simple as enabling FileVault for your boot volume. Before you
      dive in, there are a few things to weigh:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The additional volume won't be encrypted with your existing
          FileVault key, so you'll need another mechanism to decrypt
          the volume.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          You can store the password in Keychain to automatically
          decrypt the volume on boot--but it'll have to wait on Keychain
          and may not mount before your GUI apps restore. If any of
          your launchd agents or apps depend on Nix-installed software
          (for example, if you use a Nix-installed login shell), the
          restore may fail or break.
        </para>
        <para>

<title>Security</title>

<para>Nix has two basic security models.  First, it can be used in
&#x201C;single-user mode&#x201D;, which is similar to what most other package
management tools do: there is a single user (typically <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>) who performs all package
management operations.  All other users can then use the installed
packages, but they cannot perform package management operations
themselves.</para>

<para>Alternatively, you can configure Nix in &#x201C;multi-user mode&#x201D;.  In
this model, all users can perform package management operations &#x2014; for
instance, every user can install software without requiring root
privileges.  Nix ensures that this is secure.  For instance, it&#x2019;s not
possible for one user to overwrite a package used by another user with
a Trojan horse.</para>

<section xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" version="5.0" xml:id="sec-single-user">

<title>Single-User Mode</title>

<para>In single-user mode, all Nix operations that access the database
in <filename><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>/var/nix/db</filename>
or modify the Nix store in
<filename><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>/store</filename> must be
performed under the user ID that owns those directories.  This is
typically <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>.  (If you
install from RPM packages, that&#x2019;s in fact the default ownership.)
However, on single-user machines, it is often convenient to
<command>chown</command> those directories to your normal user account
so that you don&#x2019;t have to <command>su</command> to <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> all the time.</para>

</section>
<section xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" version="5.0" xml:id="ssec-multi-user">

<title>Multi-User Mode</title>

<para>To allow a Nix store to be shared safely among multiple users,
it is important that users are not able to run builders that modify
the Nix store or database in arbitrary ways, or that interfere with
builds started by other users.  If they could do so, they could
install a Trojan horse in some package and compromise the accounts of
other users.</para>

<para>To prevent this, the Nix store and database are owned by some
privileged user (usually <literal>root</literal>) and builders are
executed under special user accounts (usually named
<literal>nixbld1</literal>, <literal>nixbld2</literal>, etc.).  When a
unprivileged user runs a Nix command, actions that operate on the Nix
store (such as builds) are forwarded to a <emphasis>Nix
daemon</emphasis> running under the owner of the Nix store/database
that performs the operation.</para>

<note><para>Multi-user mode has one important limitation: only
<systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and a set of trusted
users specified in <filename>nix.conf</filename> can specify arbitrary
binary caches. So while unprivileged users may install packages from
arbitrary Nix expressions, they may not get pre-built
binaries.</para></note>


<simplesect>

<title>Setting up the build users</title>

<para>The <emphasis>build users</emphasis> are the special UIDs under
which builds are performed.  They should all be members of the
<emphasis>build users group</emphasis> <literal>nixbld</literal>.
This group should have no other members.  The build users should not
be members of any other group. On Linux, you can create the group and
users as follows:

<screen>
$ groupadd -r nixbld
$ for n in $(seq 1 10); do useradd -c "Nix build user $n" \
    -d /var/empty -g nixbld -G nixbld -M -N -r -s "$(which nologin)" \
    nixbld$n; done
</screen>

This creates 10 build users. There can never be more concurrent builds
than the number of build users, so you may want to increase this if
you expect to do many builds at the same time.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect>

<title>Running the daemon</title>

<para>The <link linkend="sec-nix-daemon">Nix daemon</link> should be
started as follows (as <literal>root</literal>):

<screen>
$ nix-daemon</screen>

You&#x2019;ll want to put that line somewhere in your system&#x2019;s boot
scripts.</para>

<para>To let unprivileged users use the daemon, they should set the
<link linkend="envar-remote"><envar>NIX_REMOTE</envar> environment
variable</link> to <literal>daemon</literal>.  So you should put a
line like

<programlisting>
export NIX_REMOTE=daemon</programlisting>

into the users&#x2019; login scripts.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect>

<title>Restricting access</title>

<para>To limit which users can perform Nix operations, you can use the
permissions on the directory
<filename>/nix/var/nix/daemon-socket</filename>.  For instance, if you
want to restrict the use of Nix to the members of a group called
<literal>nix-users</literal>, do

<screen>
$ chgrp nix-users /nix/var/nix/daemon-socket
$ chmod ug=rwx,o= /nix/var/nix/daemon-socket
</screen>

This way, users who are not in the <literal>nix-users</literal> group
cannot connect to the Unix domain socket
<filename>/nix/var/nix/daemon-socket/socket</filename>, so they cannot
perform Nix operations.</para>

</simplesect>

the Nix tools themselves, while <filename>~/.nix-profile</filename> is
a symbolic link to the current <emphasis>user environment</emphasis>

<title>Basic Package Management</title>

<para>The main command for package management is <link linkend="sec-nix-env"><command>nix-env</command></link>.  You can use
it to install, upgrade, and erase packages, and to query what
packages are installed or are available for installation.</para>

<para>In Nix, different users can have different &#x201C;views&#x201D;
on the set of installed applications.  That is, there might be lots of
applications present on the system (possibly in many different
versions), but users can have a specific selection of those active &#x2014;
where &#x201C;active&#x201D; just means that it appears in a directory
in the user&#x2019;s <envar>PATH</envar>.  Such a view on the set of
installed applications is called a <emphasis>user
environment</emphasis>, which is just a directory tree consisting of
symlinks to the files of the active applications.  </para>

<para>Components are installed from a set of <emphasis>Nix
expressions</emphasis> that tell Nix how to build those packages,
including, if necessary, their dependencies.  There is a collection of
Nix expressions called the Nixpkgs package collection that contains
packages ranging from basic development stuff such as GCC and Glibc,
to end-user applications like Mozilla Firefox.  (Nix is however not
tied to the Nixpkgs package collection; you could write your own Nix
expressions based on Nixpkgs, or completely new ones.)</para>

<para>You can manually download the latest version of Nixpkgs from
<link xlink:href="http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/download.html"/>. However,
it&#x2019;s much more convenient to use the Nixpkgs
<emphasis>channel</emphasis>, since it makes it easy to stay up to
date with new versions of Nixpkgs. (Channels are described in more
detail in <xref linkend="sec-channels"/>.) Nixpkgs is automatically
added to your list of &#x201C;subscribed&#x201D; channels when you install
Nix. If this is not the case for some reason, you can add it as
follows:

<screen>
$ nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable
$ nix-channel --update
</screen>

</para>

<note><para>On NixOS, you&#x2019;re automatically subscribed to a NixOS
channel corresponding to your NixOS major release
(e.g. <uri>http://nixos.org/channels/nixos-14.12</uri>). A NixOS
channel is identical to the Nixpkgs channel, except that it contains
only Linux binaries and is updated only if a set of regression tests
succeed.</para></note>

<para>You can view the set of available packages in Nixpkgs:

<screen>
$ nix-env -qa
aterm-2.2
bash-3.0
binutils-2.15
bison-1.875d
blackdown-1.4.2
bzip2-1.0.2
&#x2026;</screen>

The flag <option>-q</option> specifies a query operation, and
<option>-a</option> means that you want to show the &#x201C;available&#x201D; (i.e.,
installable) packages, as opposed to the installed packages. If you
downloaded Nixpkgs yourself, or if you checked it out from GitHub,
then you need to pass the path to your Nixpkgs tree using the
<option>-f</option> flag:

<screen>
$ nix-env -qaf <replaceable>/path/to/nixpkgs</replaceable>
</screen>

where <replaceable>/path/to/nixpkgs</replaceable> is where you&#x2019;ve
unpacked or checked out Nixpkgs.</para>

<para>You can select specific packages by name:

<screen>
$ nix-env -qa firefox
firefox-34.0.5
firefox-with-plugins-34.0.5
</screen>

and using regular expressions:

<screen>
$ nix-env -qa 'firefox.*'
</screen>

</para>

<para>It is also possible to see the <emphasis>status</emphasis> of
available packages, i.e., whether they are installed into the user
environment and/or present in the system:

<screen>
$ nix-env -qas
&#x2026;
-PS bash-3.0
--S binutils-2.15
IPS bison-1.875d
&#x2026;</screen>

The first character (<literal>I</literal>) indicates whether the
package is installed in your current user environment.  The second
(<literal>P</literal>) indicates whether it is present on your system
(in which case installing it into your user environment would be a
very quick operation).  The last one (<literal>S</literal>) indicates
whether there is a so-called <emphasis>substitute</emphasis> for the
package, which is Nix&#x2019;s mechanism for doing binary deployment.  It
just means that Nix knows that it can fetch a pre-built package from
somewhere (typically a network server) instead of building it
locally.</para>

<para>You can install a package using <literal>nix-env -i</literal>.
For instance,

<screen>
$ nix-env -i subversion</screen>

will install the package called <literal>subversion</literal> (which
is, of course, the <link xlink:href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion version
management system</link>).</para>

<note><para>When you ask Nix to install a package, it will first try
to get it in pre-compiled form from a <emphasis>binary
cache</emphasis>. By default, Nix will use the binary cache
<uri>https://cache.nixos.org</uri>; it contains binaries for most
packages in Nixpkgs. Only if no binary is available in the binary
cache, Nix will build the package from source. So if <literal>nix-env
-i subversion</literal> results in Nix building stuff from source,
then either the package is not built for your platform by the Nixpkgs
build servers, or your version of Nixpkgs is too old or too new. For
instance, if you have a very recent checkout of Nixpkgs, then the
Nixpkgs build servers may not have had a chance to build everything
and upload the resulting binaries to
<uri>https://cache.nixos.org</uri>. The Nixpkgs channel is only
updated after all binaries have been uploaded to the cache, so if you
stick to the Nixpkgs channel (rather than using a Git checkout of the
Nixpkgs tree), you will get binaries for most packages.</para></note>

<para>Naturally, packages can also be uninstalled:

<screen>
$ nix-env -e subversion</screen>

</para>

<para>Upgrading to a new version is just as easy.  If you have a new
release of Nix Packages, you can do:

<screen>
$ nix-env -u subversion</screen>

This will <emphasis>only</emphasis> upgrade Subversion if there is a
&#x201C;newer&#x201D; version in the new set of Nix expressions, as
defined by some pretty arbitrary rules regarding ordering of version
numbers (which generally do what you&#x2019;d expect of them).  To just
unconditionally replace Subversion with whatever version is in the Nix
expressions, use <parameter>-i</parameter> instead of
<parameter>-u</parameter>; <parameter>-i</parameter> will remove
whatever version is already installed.</para>

<para>You can also upgrade all packages for which there are newer
versions:

<screen>
$ nix-env -u</screen>

</para>

<para>Sometimes it&#x2019;s useful to be able to ask what
<command>nix-env</command> would do, without actually doing it.  For
instance, to find out what packages would be upgraded by
<literal>nix-env -u</literal>, you can do

<screen>
$ nix-env -u --dry-run
(dry run; not doing anything)
upgrading `libxslt-1.1.0' to `libxslt-1.1.10'
upgrading `graphviz-1.10' to `graphviz-1.12'
upgrading `coreutils-5.0' to `coreutils-5.2.1'</screen>

</para>

<title>Profiles</title>

<para>Profiles and user environments are Nix&#x2019;s mechanism for
implementing the ability to allow different users to have different
configurations, and to do atomic upgrades and rollbacks.  To
understand how they work, it&#x2019;s useful to know a bit about how Nix
works.  In Nix, packages are stored in unique locations in the
<emphasis>Nix store</emphasis> (typically,
<filename>/nix/store</filename>).  For instance, a particular version
of the Subversion package might be stored in a directory
<filename>/nix/store/dpmvp969yhdqs7lm2r1a3gng7pyq6vy4-subversion-1.1.3/</filename>,
while another version might be stored in
<filename>/nix/store/5mq2jcn36ldlmh93yj1n8s9c95pj7c5s-subversion-1.1.2</filename>.
The long strings prefixed to the directory names are cryptographic
hashes<footnote><para>160-bit truncations of SHA-256 hashes encoded in
a base-32 notation, to be precise.</para></footnote> of
<emphasis>all</emphasis> inputs involved in building the package &#x2014;
sources, dependencies, compiler flags, and so on.  So if two
packages differ in any way, they end up in different locations in
the file system, so they don&#x2019;t interfere with each other.  <xref linkend="fig-user-environments"/> shows a part of a typical Nix
store.</para>

<figure xml:id="fig-user-environments"><title>User environments</title>
  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="../figures/user-environments.png" format="PNG"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>Of course, you wouldn&#x2019;t want to type

<screen>
$ /nix/store/dpmvp969yhdq...-subversion-1.1.3/bin/svn</screen>

every time you want to run Subversion.  Of course we could set up the
<envar>PATH</envar> environment variable to include the
<filename>bin</filename> directory of every package we want to use,
but this is not very convenient since changing <envar>PATH</envar>
doesn&#x2019;t take effect for already existing processes.  The solution Nix
uses is to create directory trees of symlinks to
<emphasis>activated</emphasis> packages.  These are called
<emphasis>user environments</emphasis> and they are packages
themselves (though automatically generated by
<command>nix-env</command>), so they too reside in the Nix store.  For
instance, in <xref linkend="fig-user-environments"/> the user
environment <filename>/nix/store/0c1p5z4kda11...-user-env</filename>
contains a symlink to just Subversion 1.1.2 (arrows in the figure
indicate symlinks).  This would be what we would obtain if we had done

<screen>
$ nix-env -i subversion</screen>

on a set of Nix expressions that contained Subversion 1.1.2.</para>

<para>This doesn&#x2019;t in itself solve the problem, of course; you
wouldn&#x2019;t want to type
<filename>/nix/store/0c1p5z4kda11...-user-env/bin/svn</filename>
either.  That&#x2019;s why there are symlinks outside of the store that point
to the user environments in the store; for instance, the symlinks
<filename>default-42-link</filename> and
<filename>default-43-link</filename> in the example.  These are called
<emphasis>generations</emphasis> since every time you perform a
<command>nix-env</command> operation, a new user environment is
generated based on the current one.  For instance, generation 43 was
created from generation 42 when we did

<screen>
$ nix-env -i subversion firefox</screen>

on a set of Nix expressions that contained Firefox and a new version
of Subversion.</para>

<para>Generations are grouped together into
<emphasis>profiles</emphasis> so that different users don&#x2019;t interfere
with each other if they don&#x2019;t want to.  For example:

<screen>
$ ls -l /nix/var/nix/profiles/
...
lrwxrwxrwx  1 eelco ... default-42-link -&gt; /nix/store/0c1p5z4kda11...-user-env
lrwxrwxrwx  1 eelco ... default-43-link -&gt; /nix/store/3aw2pdyx2jfc...-user-env
lrwxrwxrwx  1 eelco ... default -&gt; default-43-link</screen>

This shows a profile called <filename>default</filename>.  The file
<filename>default</filename> itself is actually a symlink that points
to the current generation.  When we do a <command>nix-env</command>
operation, a new user environment and generation link are created
based on the current one, and finally the <filename>default</filename>
symlink is made to point at the new generation.  This last step is
atomic on Unix, which explains how we can do atomic upgrades.  (Note
that the building/installing of new packages doesn&#x2019;t interfere in
any way with old packages, since they are stored in different
locations in the Nix store.)</para>

<para>If you find that you want to undo a <command>nix-env</command>
operation, you can just do

<screen>
$ nix-env --rollback</screen>

which will just make the current generation link point at the previous
link.  E.g., <filename>default</filename> would be made to point at
<filename>default-42-link</filename>.  You can also switch to a
specific generation:

<screen>
$ nix-env --switch-generation 43</screen>

which in this example would roll forward to generation 43 again.  You
can also see all available generations:

<screen>
$ nix-env --list-generations</screen></para>

<para>You generally wouldn&#x2019;t have
<filename>/nix/var/nix/profiles/<replaceable>some-profile</replaceable>/bin</filename>
in your <envar>PATH</envar>.  Rather, there is a symlink
<filename>~/.nix-profile</filename> that points to your current
profile.  This means that you should put
<filename>~/.nix-profile/bin</filename> in your <envar>PATH</envar>
(and indeed, that&#x2019;s what the initialisation script
<filename>/nix/etc/profile.d/nix.sh</filename> does).  This makes it
easier to switch to a different profile.  You can do that using the
command <command>nix-env --switch-profile</command>:

<screen>
$ nix-env --switch-profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/my-profile

$ nix-env --switch-profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/default</screen>

These commands switch to the <filename>my-profile</filename> and
default profile, respectively.  If the profile doesn&#x2019;t exist, it will
be created automatically.  You should be careful about storing a
profile in another location than the <filename>profiles</filename>
directory, since otherwise it might not be used as a root of the
garbage collector (see <xref linkend="sec-garbage-collection"/>).</para>

<para>All <command>nix-env</command> operations work on the profile
pointed to by <command>~/.nix-profile</command>, but you can override
this using the <option>--profile</option> option (abbreviation
<option>-p</option>):

<screen>
$ nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/other-profile -i subversion</screen>

This will <emphasis>not</emphasis> change the
<command>~/.nix-profile</command> symlink.</para>

<title>Garbage Collection</title>

<para><command>nix-env</command> operations such as upgrades
(<option>-u</option>) and uninstall (<option>-e</option>) never
actually delete packages from the system.  All they do (as shown
above) is to create a new user environment that no longer contains
symlinks to the &#x201C;deleted&#x201D; packages.</para>

<para>Of course, since disk space is not infinite, unused packages
should be removed at some point.  You can do this by running the Nix
garbage collector.  It will remove from the Nix store any package
not used (directly or indirectly) by any generation of any
profile.</para>

<para>Note however that as long as old generations reference a
package, it will not be deleted.  After all, we wouldn&#x2019;t be able to
do a rollback otherwise.  So in order for garbage collection to be
effective, you should also delete (some) old generations.  Of course,
this should only be done if you are certain that you will not need to
roll back.</para>

<para>To delete all old (non-current) generations of your current
profile:

<screen>
$ nix-env --delete-generations old</screen>

Instead of <literal>old</literal> you can also specify a list of
generations, e.g.,

<screen>
$ nix-env --delete-generations 10 11 14</screen>

To delete all generations older than a specified number of days
(except the current generation), use the <literal>d</literal>
suffix. For example,

<screen>
$ nix-env --delete-generations 14d</screen>

deletes all generations older than two weeks.</para>

<para>After removing appropriate old generations you can run the
garbage collector as follows:

<screen>
$ nix-store --gc</screen>

The behaviour of the gargage collector is affected by the 
<literal>keep-derivations</literal> (default: true) and <literal>keep-outputs</literal>
(default: false) options in the Nix configuration file. The defaults will ensure
that all derivations that are build-time dependencies of garbage collector roots
will be kept and that all output paths that are runtime dependencies
will be kept as well. All other derivations or paths will be collected. 
(This is usually what you want, but while you are developing
it may make sense to keep outputs to ensure that rebuild times are quick.)

If you are feeling uncertain, you can also first view what files would
be deleted:

<screen>
$ nix-store --gc --print-dead</screen>

Likewise, the option <option>--print-live</option> will show the paths
that <emphasis>won&#x2019;t</emphasis> be deleted.</para>

<para>There is also a convenient little utility
<command>nix-collect-garbage</command>, which when invoked with the
<option>-d</option> (<option>--delete-old</option>) switch deletes all
old generations of all profiles in
<filename>/nix/var/nix/profiles</filename>.  So

<screen>
$ nix-collect-garbage -d</screen>

is a quick and easy way to clean up your system.</para>

<title>Garbage Collector Roots</title>

<para>The roots of the garbage collector are all store paths to which
there are symlinks in the directory
<filename><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>/nix/var/nix/gcroots</filename>.
For instance, the following command makes the path
<filename>/nix/store/d718ef...-foo</filename> a root of the collector:

<screen>
$ ln -s /nix/store/d718ef...-foo /nix/var/nix/gcroots/bar</screen>
	
That is, after this command, the garbage collector will not remove
<filename>/nix/store/d718ef...-foo</filename> or any of its
dependencies.</para>

<para>Subdirectories of
<filename><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>/nix/var/nix/gcroots</filename>
are also searched for symlinks.  Symlinks to non-store paths are
followed and searched for roots, but symlinks to non-store paths
<emphasis>inside</emphasis> the paths reached in that way are not
followed to prevent infinite recursion.</para>

<para>If you want to stay up to date with a set of packages, it&#x2019;s not
very convenient to manually download the latest set of Nix expressions

Fortunately, there&#x2019;s a better way: <emphasis>Nix
channels</emphasis>.</para>

<para>A Nix channel is just a URL that points to a place that contains
a set of Nix expressions and a manifest.  Using the command <link linkend="sec-nix-channel"><command>nix-channel</command></link> you
can automatically stay up to date with whatever is available at that
URL.</para>
      
<para>To see the list of official NixOS channels, visit <link xlink:href="https://nixos.org/channels"/>.</para>

<para>You can &#x201C;subscribe&#x201D; to a channel using
<command>nix-channel --add</command>, e.g.,

<screen>
$ nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable</screen>

subscribes you to a channel that always contains that latest version
of the Nix Packages collection.  (Subscribing really just means that
the URL is added to the file <filename>~/.nix-channels</filename>,
where it is read by subsequent calls to <command>nix-channel
--update</command>.) You can &#x201C;unsubscribe&#x201D; using <command>nix-channel
--remove</command>:

<screen>
$ nix-channel --remove nixpkgs

</para>

<para>To obtain the latest Nix expressions available in a channel, do

<screen>
$ nix-channel --update</screen>

This downloads and unpacks the Nix expressions in every channel
(downloaded from <literal><replaceable>url</replaceable>/nixexprs.tar.bz2</literal>).
It also makes the union of each channel&#x2019;s Nix expressions available by
default to <command>nix-env</command> operations (via the symlink
<filename>~/.nix-defexpr/channels</filename>).  Consequently, you can
then say

<screen>
$ nix-env -u</screen>

to upgrade all packages in your profile to the latest versions
available in the subscribed channels.</para>

<title>Sharing Packages Between Machines</title>

<para>Sometimes you want to copy a package from one machine to

packages between machines.</para>

<title>Serving a Nix store via HTTP</title>

<para>You can easily share the Nix store of a machine via HTTP. This
allows other machines to fetch store paths from that machine to speed
up installations. It uses the same <emphasis>binary cache</emphasis>
mechanism that Nix usually uses to fetch pre-built binaries from
<uri>https://cache.nixos.org</uri>.</para>

<para>The daemon that handles binary cache requests via HTTP,
<command>nix-serve</command>, is not part of the Nix distribution, but
you can install it from Nixpkgs:

<screen>
$ nix-env -i nix-serve
</screen>

You can then start the server, listening for HTTP connections on
whatever port you like:

<screen>
$ nix-serve -p 8080
</screen>

To check whether it works, try the following on the client:

<screen>
$ curl http://avalon:8080/nix-cache-info
</screen>

which should print something like:

<screen>
StoreDir: /nix/store
WantMassQuery: 1
Priority: 30
</screen>

</para>

<para>On the client side, you can tell Nix to use your binary cache
using <option>--option extra-binary-caches</option>, e.g.:

<screen>
$ nix-env -i firefox --option extra-binary-caches http://avalon:8080/
</screen>

The option <option>extra-binary-caches</option> tells Nix to use this
binary cache in addition to your default caches, such as
<uri>https://cache.nixos.org</uri>. Thus, for any path in the closure
of Firefox, Nix will first check if the path is available on the
server <literal>avalon</literal> or another binary caches. If not, it
will fall back to building from source.</para>

<para>You can also tell Nix to always use your binary cache by adding
a line to the <filename linkend="sec-conf-file">nix.conf</filename>

<programlisting>
binary-caches = http://avalon:8080/ https://cache.nixos.org/

<title>Copying Closures Via SSH</title>

<para>The command <command linkend="sec-nix-copy-closure">nix-copy-closure</command> copies a Nix
store path along with all its dependencies to or from another machine
via the SSH protocol.  It doesn&#x2019;t copy store paths that are already
present on the target machine.  For example, the following command
copies Firefox with all its dependencies:

<screen>
$ nix-copy-closure --to alice@itchy.example.org $(type -p firefox)</screen>

See <xref linkend="sec-nix-copy-closure"/> for details.</para>

<para>With <command linkend="refsec-nix-store-export">nix-store
--export</command> and <command linkend="refsec-nix-store-import">nix-store --import</command> you can
write the closure of a store path (that is, the path and all its
dependencies) to a file, and then unpack that file into another Nix
store.  For example,

<screen>
$ nix-store --export $(nix-store -qR $(type -p firefox)) &gt; firefox.closure</screen>

writes the closure of Firefox to a file.  You can then copy this file
to another machine and install the closure:

<screen>
$ nix-store --import &lt; firefox.closure</screen>

Any store paths in the closure that are already present in the target
store are ignored.  It is also possible to pipe the export into
another command, e.g. to copy and install a closure directly to/on
another machine:

<screen>
$ nix-store --export $(nix-store -qR $(type -p firefox)) | bzip2 | \

However, <command>nix-copy-closure</command> is generally more
efficient because it only copies paths that are not already present in

<title>Serving a Nix store via SSH</title>

<para>You can tell Nix to automatically fetch needed binaries from a
remote Nix store via SSH. For example, the following installs Firefox,
automatically fetching any store paths in Firefox&#x2019;s closure if they
are available on the server <literal>avalon</literal>:

<screen>
$ nix-env -i firefox --substituters ssh://alice@avalon
</screen>

This works similar to the binary cache substituter that Nix usually
uses, only using SSH instead of HTTP: if a store path
<literal>P</literal> is needed, Nix will first check if it&#x2019;s available
in the Nix store on <literal>avalon</literal>. If not, it will fall
back to using the binary cache substituter, and then to building from
source.</para>

<note><para>The SSH substituter currently does not allow you to enter
an SSH passphrase interactively. Therefore, you should use
<command>ssh-add</command> to load the decrypted private key into
<command>ssh-agent</command>.</para></note>

<para>You can also copy the closure of some store path, without
installing it into your profile, e.g.

<screen>
$ nix-store -r /nix/store/m85bxg&#x2026;-firefox-34.0.5 --substituters ssh://alice@avalon
</screen>

This is essentially equivalent to doing

<screen>
$ nix-copy-closure --from alice@avalon /nix/store/m85bxg&#x2026;-firefox-34.0.5
</screen>

</para>

<para>You can use SSH&#x2019;s <emphasis>forced command</emphasis> feature to
set up a restricted user account for SSH substituter access, allowing
read-only access to the local Nix store, but nothing more. For
example, add the following lines to <filename>sshd_config</filename>
to restrict the user <literal>nix-ssh</literal>:

<programlisting>
Match User nix-ssh
  AllowAgentForwarding no
  AllowTcpForwarding no
  PermitTTY no
  PermitTunnel no
  X11Forwarding no
  ForceCommand nix-store --serve
Match All
</programlisting>

On NixOS, you can accomplish the same by adding the following to your
<filename>configuration.nix</filename>:

<programlisting>
nix.sshServe.enable = true;
nix.sshServe.keys = [ "ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1k... bob@example.org" ];
</programlisting>

where the latter line lists the public keys of users that are allowed
to connect.</para>

on to a more in-depth look at the Nix expression language.</para>

<title>A Simple Nix Expression</title>

<para>This section shows how to add and test the <link xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/hello.html">GNU Hello

that prints out the text <quote>Hello, world!</quote>.</para>

<para>To add a package to the Nix Packages collection, you generally
need to do three things:

<orderedlist>

  <listitem><para>Write a Nix expression for the package.  This is a
  file that describes all the inputs involved in building the package,
  such as dependencies, sources, and so on.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Write a <emphasis>builder</emphasis>.  This is a
  shell script<footnote><para>In fact, it can be written in any
  language, but typically it's a <command>bash</command> shell
  script.</para></footnote> that actually builds the package from
  the inputs.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Add the package to the file
  <filename>pkgs/top-level/all-packages.nix</filename>.  The Nix
  expression written in the first step is a
  <emphasis>function</emphasis>; it requires other packages in order
  to build it.  In this step you put it all together, i.e., you call
  the function with the right arguments to build the actual
  package.</para></listitem>

</example>

<para><xref linkend="ex-hello-nix"/> shows a Nix expression for GNU
Hello.  It's actually already in the Nix Packages collection in
<filename>pkgs/applications/misc/hello/ex-1/default.nix</filename>.
It is customary to place each package in a separate directory and call
the single Nix expression in that directory
<filename>default.nix</filename>.  The file has the following elements
(referenced from the figure by number):

<calloutlist>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-nix-co-1">

    <para>This states that the expression is a
    <emphasis>function</emphasis> that expects to be called with three
    arguments: <varname>stdenv</varname>, <varname>fetchurl</varname>,
    and <varname>perl</varname>.  They are needed to build Hello, but
    we don't know how to build them here; that's why they are function
    arguments.  <varname>stdenv</varname> is a package that is used
    by almost all Nix Packages packages; it provides a
    <quote>standard</quote> environment consisting of the things you
    would expect in a basic Unix environment: a C/C++ compiler (GCC,
    to be precise), the Bash shell, fundamental Unix tools such as
    <command>cp</command>, <command>grep</command>,
    <command>tar</command>, etc.  <varname>fetchurl</varname> is a
    function that downloads files.  <varname>perl</varname> is the
    Perl interpreter.</para>

    <para>Nix functions generally have the form <literal>{ x, y, ...,
    z }: e</literal> where <varname>x</varname>, <varname>y</varname>,
    etc. are the names of the expected arguments, and where
    <replaceable>e</replaceable> is the body of the function.  So
    here, the entire remainder of the file is the body of the
    function; when given the required arguments, the body should
    describe how to build an instance of the Hello package.</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-nix-co-2">

    <para>So we have to build a package.  Building something from
    other stuff is called a <emphasis>derivation</emphasis> in Nix (as
    opposed to sources, which are built by humans instead of
    computers).  We perform a derivation by calling
    <varname>stdenv.mkDerivation</varname>.
    <varname>mkDerivation</varname> is a function provided by
    <varname>stdenv</varname> that builds a package from a set of
    <emphasis>attributes</emphasis>.  A set is just a list of
    key/value pairs where each key is a string and each value is an
    arbitrary Nix expression.  They take the general form <literal>{
    <replaceable>name1</replaceable> =
    <replaceable>expr1</replaceable>; <replaceable>...</replaceable>
    <replaceable>nameN</replaceable> =
    <replaceable>exprN</replaceable>; }</literal>.</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-nix-co-3">

    <para>The attribute <varname>name</varname> specifies the symbolic
    name and version of the package.  Nix doesn't really care about
    these things, but they are used by for instance <command>nix-env
    -q</command> to show a <quote>human-readable</quote> name for
    packages.  This attribute is required by
    <varname>mkDerivation</varname>.</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-nix-co-4">

    <para>The attribute <varname>builder</varname> specifies the
    builder.  This attribute can sometimes be omitted, in which case
    <varname>mkDerivation</varname> will fill in a default builder
    (which does a <literal>configure; make; make install</literal>, in
    essence).  Hello is sufficiently simple that the default builder
    would suffice, but in this case, we will show an actual builder
    for educational purposes.  The value
    <command>./builder.sh</command> refers to the shell script shown
    in <xref linkend="ex-hello-builder"/>, discussed below.</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-nix-co-5">

    <para>The builder has to know what the sources of the package
    are.  Here, the attribute <varname>src</varname> is bound to the
    result of a call to the <command>fetchurl</command> function.
    Given a URL and a SHA-256 hash of the expected contents of the file
    at that URL, this function builds a derivation that downloads the
    file and checks its hash.  So the sources are a dependency that
    like all other dependencies is built before Hello itself is
    built.</para>

    <para>Instead of <varname>src</varname> any other name could have
    been used, and in fact there can be any number of sources (bound
    to different attributes).  However, <varname>src</varname> is
    customary, and it's also expected by the default builder (which we
    don't use in this example).</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-nix-co-6">

    <para>Since the derivation requires Perl, we have to pass the
    value of the <varname>perl</varname> function argument to the
    builder.  All attributes in the set are actually passed as
    environment variables to the builder, so declaring an attribute

    <programlisting>
perl = perl;</programlisting>

    will do the trick: it binds an attribute <varname>perl</varname>
    to the function argument which also happens to be called
    <varname>perl</varname>.  However, it looks a bit silly, so there
    is a shorter syntax.  The <literal>inherit</literal> keyword
    causes the specified attributes to be bound to whatever variables
    with the same name happen to be in scope.</para>

<para><xref linkend="ex-hello-builder"/> shows the builder referenced
from Hello's Nix expression (stored in
<filename>pkgs/applications/misc/hello/ex-1/builder.sh</filename>).
The builder can actually be made a lot shorter by using the
<emphasis>generic builder</emphasis> functions provided by
<varname>stdenv</varname>, but here we write out the build steps to
elucidate what a builder does.  It performs the following
steps:</para>

<calloutlist>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-builder-co-1">

    <para>When Nix runs a builder, it initially completely clears the
    environment (except for the attributes declared in the
    derivation).  For instance, the <envar>PATH</envar> variable is
    empty<footnote><para>Actually, it's initialised to
    <filename>/path-not-set</filename> to prevent Bash from setting it
    to a default value.</para></footnote>.  This is done to prevent
    undeclared inputs from being used in the build process.  If for
    example the <envar>PATH</envar> contained
    <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, then you might accidentally use
    <filename>/usr/bin/gcc</filename>.</para>

    <para>So the first step is to set up the environment.  This is
    done by calling the <filename>setup</filename> script of the
    standard environment.  The environment variable
    <envar>stdenv</envar> points to the location of the standard
    environment being used.  (It wasn't specified explicitly as an
    attribute in <xref linkend="ex-hello-nix"/>, but
    <varname>mkDerivation</varname> adds it automatically.)</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-builder-co-2">

    <para>Since Hello needs Perl, we have to make sure that Perl is in
    the <envar>PATH</envar>.  The <envar>perl</envar> environment
    variable points to the location of the Perl package (since it
    was passed in as an attribute to the derivation), so
    <filename><replaceable>$perl</replaceable>/bin</filename> is the
    directory containing the Perl interpreter.</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-builder-co-3">

    <para>Now we have to unpack the sources.  The
    <varname>src</varname> attribute was bound to the result of
    fetching the Hello source tarball from the network, so the
    <envar>src</envar> environment variable points to the location in
    the Nix store to which the tarball was downloaded.  After
    unpacking, we <command>cd</command> to the resulting source
    directory.</para>

    <para>The whole build is performed in a temporary directory
    created in <varname>/tmp</varname>, by the way.  This directory is
    removed after the builder finishes, so there is no need to clean
    up the sources afterwards.  Also, the temporary directory is
    always newly created, so you don't have to worry about files from
    previous builds interfering with the current build.</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-builder-co-4">

    <para>GNU Hello is a typical Autoconf-based package, so we first
    have to run its <filename>configure</filename> script.  In Nix
    every package is stored in a separate location in the Nix store,
    for instance
    <filename>/nix/store/9a54ba97fb71b65fda531012d0443ce2-hello-2.1.1</filename>.
    Nix computes this path by cryptographically hashing all attributes
    of the derivation.  The path is passed to the builder through the
    <envar>out</envar> environment variable.  So here we give
    <filename>configure</filename> the parameter
    <literal>--prefix=$out</literal> to cause Hello to be installed in
    the expected location.</para>

  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-hello-builder-co-5">

    <para>Finally we build Hello (<literal>make</literal>) and install
    it into the location specified by <envar>out</envar>
    (<literal>make install</literal>).</para>

  </callout>

</calloutlist>

<para>If you are wondering about the absence of error checking on the
result of various commands called in the builder: this is because the
shell script is evaluated with Bash's <option>-e</option> option,
which causes the script to be aborted if any command fails without an
error check.</para>

<title>Building and Testing</title>

<para>You can now try to build Hello.  Of course, you could do
<literal>nix-env -i hello</literal>, but you may not want to install a
possibly broken package just yet.  The best way to test the package is by
using the command <command linkend="sec-nix-build">nix-build</command>,
which builds a Nix expression and creates a symlink named
<filename>result</filename> in the current directory:

<screen>
$ nix-build -A hello
building path `/nix/store/632d2b22514d...-hello-2.1.1'
hello-2.1.1/
hello-2.1.1/intl/
hello-2.1.1/intl/ChangeLog
<replaceable>...</replaceable>

$ ls -l result
lrwxrwxrwx ... 2006-09-29 10:43 result -&gt; /nix/store/632d2b22514d...-hello-2.1.1

$ ./result/bin/hello
Hello, world!</screen>

The <link linkend="opt-attr"><option>-A</option></link> option selects
the <literal>hello</literal> attribute.  This is faster than using the
symbolic package name specified by the <literal>name</literal>
attribute (which also happens to be <literal>hello</literal>) and is
unambiguous (there can be multiple packages with the symbolic name
<literal>hello</literal>, but there can be only one attribute in a set
named <literal>hello</literal>).</para>

<para><command>nix-build</command> registers the
<filename>./result</filename> symlink as a garbage collection root, so
unless and until you delete the <filename>./result</filename> symlink,
the output of the build will be safely kept on your system.  You can
use <command>nix-build</command>&#x2019;s <option linkend="opt-out-link">-o</option> switch to give the symlink another
name.</para>

<para>Nix has transactional semantics.  Once a build finishes
successfully, Nix makes a note of this in its database: it registers
that the path denoted by <envar>out</envar> is now
<quote>valid</quote>.  If you try to build the derivation again, Nix
will see that the path is already valid and finish immediately.  If a
build fails, either because it returns a non-zero exit code, because
Nix or the builder are killed, or because the machine crashes, then
the output paths will not be registered as valid.  If you try to build
the derivation again, Nix will remove the output paths if they exist
(e.g., because the builder died half-way through <literal>make
install</literal>) and try again.  Note that there is no
<quote>negative caching</quote>: Nix doesn't remember that a build
failed, and so a failed build can always be repeated.  This is because
Nix cannot distinguish between permanent failures (e.g., a compiler
error due to a syntax error in the source) and transient failures
(e.g., a disk full condition).</para>

<para>Nix also performs locking.  If you run multiple Nix builds
simultaneously, and they try to build the same derivation, the first
Nix instance that gets there will perform the build, while the others
block (or perform other derivations if available) until the build
finishes:

<screen>
$ nix-build -A hello
waiting for lock on `/nix/store/0h5b7hp8d4hqfrw8igvx97x1xawrjnac-hello-2.1.1x'</screen>

So it is always safe to run multiple instances of Nix in parallel
(which isn&#x2019;t the case with, say, <command>make</command>).</para>

<title>Generic Builder Syntax</title>

<para>Recall from <xref linkend="ex-hello-builder"/> that the builder
looked something like this:

<programlisting>
PATH=$perl/bin:$PATH
tar xvfz $src
cd hello-*
./configure --prefix=$out
make
make install</programlisting>

The builders for almost all Unix packages look like this &#x2014; set up some
environment variables, unpack the sources, configure, build, and
install.  For this reason the standard environment provides some Bash
functions that automate the build process.  A builder using the
generic build facilities in shown in <xref linkend="ex-hello-builder2"/>.</para>

<para>Discerning readers will note that the

In fact, <varname>mkDerivation</varname> provides a default builder
that looks exactly like that, so it is actually possible to omit the

<title>Nix Expression Language</title>

<para>The Nix expression language is a pure, lazy, functional
language.  Purity means that operations in the language don't have
side-effects (for instance, there is no variable assignment).
Laziness means that arguments to functions are evaluated only when
they are needed.  Functional means that functions are
<quote>normal</quote> values that can be passed around and manipulated
in interesting ways.  The language is not a full-featured, general
purpose language.  Its main job is to describe packages,
compositions of packages, and the variability within
packages.</para>

<para>This section presents the various features of the
language.</para>

<section xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" version="5.0" xml:id="ssec-values">

<title>Values</title>


<simplesect><title>Simple Values</title>

<para>Nix has the following basic data types:

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>

    <para><emphasis>Strings</emphasis> can be written in three
    ways.</para>

    <para>The most common way is to enclose the string between double
    quotes, e.g., <literal>"foo bar"</literal>.  Strings can span
    multiple lines.  The special characters <literal>"</literal> and
    <literal>\</literal> and the character sequence
    <literal>${</literal> must be escaped by prefixing them with a
    backslash (<literal>\</literal>).  Newlines, carriage returns and
    tabs can be written as <literal>\n</literal>,
    <literal>\r</literal> and <literal>\t</literal>,
    respectively.</para>

    <para>You can include the result of an expression into a string by
    enclosing it in
    <literal>${<replaceable>...</replaceable>}</literal>, a feature
    known as <emphasis>antiquotation</emphasis>.  The enclosed
    expression must evaluate to something that can be coerced into a
    string (meaning that it must be a string, a path, or a
    derivation).  For instance, rather than writing

<programlisting>
"--with-freetype2-library=" + freetype + "/lib"</programlisting>

    (where <varname>freetype</varname> is a derivation), you can
    instead write the more natural

<programlisting>
"--with-freetype2-library=${freetype}/lib"</programlisting>

    The latter is automatically translated to the former.  A more
    complicated example (from the Nix expression for <link xlink:href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</link>):

<programlisting>
configureFlags = "
  -system-zlib -system-libpng -system-libjpeg
  ${if openglSupport then "-dlopen-opengl
    -L${mesa}/lib -I${mesa}/include
    -L${libXmu}/lib -I${libXmu}/include" else ""}
  ${if threadSupport then "-thread" else "-no-thread"}
";</programlisting>

    Note that Nix expressions and strings can be arbitrarily nested;
    in this case the outer string contains various antiquotations that
    themselves contain strings (e.g., <literal>"-thread"</literal>),
    some of which in turn contain expressions (e.g.,
    <literal>${mesa}</literal>).</para>

    <para>The second way to write string literals is as an
    <emphasis>indented string</emphasis>, which is enclosed between
    pairs of <emphasis>double single-quotes</emphasis>, like so:

<programlisting>
''
  This is the first line.
  This is the second line.
    This is the third line.
''</programlisting>

    This kind of string literal intelligently strips indentation from
    the start of each line.  To be precise, it strips from each line a
    number of spaces equal to the minimal indentation of the string as
    a whole (disregarding the indentation of empty lines).  For
    instance, the first and second line are indented two space, while
    the third line is indented four spaces.  Thus, two spaces are
    stripped from each line, so the resulting string is

<programlisting>
"This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.\n  This is the third line.\n"</programlisting>

    </para>

    <para>Note that the whitespace and newline following the opening
    <literal>''</literal> is ignored if there is no non-whitespace
    text on the initial line.</para>

    <para>Antiquotation
    (<literal>${<replaceable>expr</replaceable>}</literal>) is
    supported in indented strings.</para>

    <para>Since <literal>${</literal> and <literal>''</literal> have
    special meaning in indented strings, you need a way to quote them.
    <literal>$</literal> can be escaped by prefixing it with
    <literal>''</literal> (that is, two single quotes), i.e.,
    <literal>''$</literal>. <literal>''</literal> can be escaped by
    prefixing it with <literal>'</literal>, i.e.,
    <literal>'''</literal>. <literal>$</literal> removes any special meaning
    from the following <literal>$</literal>. Linefeed, carriage-return and tab
    characters can be written as <literal>''\n</literal>,
    <literal>''\r</literal>, <literal>''\t</literal>, and <literal>''\</literal>
    escapes any other character.

    </para>

    <para>Indented strings are primarily useful in that they allow
    multi-line string literals to follow the indentation of the
    enclosing Nix expression, and that less escaping is typically
    necessary for strings representing languages such as shell scripts
    and configuration files because <literal>''</literal> is much less
    common than <literal>"</literal>.  Example:

<programlisting>
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
  postInstall =
    ''
      mkdir $out/bin $out/etc
      cp foo $out/bin
      echo "Hello World" &gt; $out/etc/foo.conf
      ${if enableBar then "cp bar $out/bin" else ""}
    '';
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
}
</programlisting>

    </para>

    <para>Finally, as a convenience, <emphasis>URIs</emphasis> as
    defined in appendix B of <link xlink:href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2396</link>
    can be written <emphasis>as is</emphasis>, without quotes.  For
    instance, the string
    <literal>"http://example.org/foo.tar.bz2"</literal>
    can also be written as
    <literal>http://example.org/foo.tar.bz2</literal>.</para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>Numbers, which can be <emphasis>integers</emphasis> (like
  <literal>123</literal>) or <emphasis>floating point</emphasis> (like
  <literal>123.43</literal> or <literal>.27e13</literal>).</para>

  <para>Numbers are type-compatible: pure integer operations will always
  return integers, whereas any operation involving at least one floating point
  number will have a floating point number as a result.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Paths</emphasis>, e.g.,
  <filename>/bin/sh</filename> or <filename>./builder.sh</filename>.
  A path must contain at least one slash to be recognised as such; for
  instance, <filename>builder.sh</filename> is not a
  path<footnote><para>It's parsed as an expression that selects the
  attribute <varname>sh</varname> from the variable
  <varname>builder</varname>.</para></footnote>.  If the file name is
  relative, i.e., if it does not begin with a slash, it is made
  absolute at parse time relative to the directory of the Nix
  expression that contained it.  For instance, if a Nix expression in
  <filename>/foo/bar/bla.nix</filename> refers to
  <filename>../xyzzy/fnord.nix</filename>, the absolute path is
  <filename>/foo/xyzzy/fnord.nix</filename>.</para>

  <para>If the first component of a path is a <literal>~</literal>,
  it is interpreted as if the rest of the path were relative to the
  user's home directory. e.g. <filename>~/foo</filename> would be
  equivalent to <filename>/home/edolstra/foo</filename> for a user
  whose home directory is <filename>/home/edolstra</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>Paths can also be specified between angle brackets, e.g.
  <literal>&lt;nixpkgs&gt;</literal>. This means that the directories
  listed in the environment variable
  <envar linkend="env-NIX_PATH">NIX_PATH</envar> will be searched
  for the given file or directory name.
  </para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Booleans</emphasis> with values
  <literal>true</literal> and
  <literal>false</literal>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The null value, denoted as
  <literal>null</literal>.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Lists</title>

<para>Lists are formed by enclosing a whitespace-separated list of
values between square brackets.  For example,

<programlisting>
[ 123 ./foo.nix "abc" (f { x = y; }) ]</programlisting>

defines a list of four elements, the last being the result of a call
to the function <varname>f</varname>.  Note that function calls have
to be enclosed in parentheses.  If they had been omitted, e.g.,

<programlisting>
[ 123 ./foo.nix "abc" f { x = y; } ]</programlisting>

the result would be a list of five elements, the fourth one being a
function and the fifth being a set.</para>

<para>Note that lists are only lazy in values, and they are strict in length.
</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Sets</title>

<para>Sets are really the core of the language, since ultimately the
Nix language is all about creating derivations, which are really just
sets of attributes to be passed to build scripts.</para>

<para>Sets are just a list of name/value pairs (called
<emphasis>attributes</emphasis>) enclosed in curly brackets, where
each value is an arbitrary expression terminated by a semicolon.  For
example:

<programlisting>
{ x = 123;
  text = "Hello";
  y = f { bla = 456; };
}</programlisting>

This defines a set with attributes named <varname>x</varname>,
<varname>text</varname>, <varname>y</varname>.  The order of the
attributes is irrelevant.  An attribute name may only occur
once.</para>

<para>Attributes can be selected from a set using the
<literal>.</literal> operator.  For instance,

<programlisting>
{ a = "Foo"; b = "Bar"; }.a</programlisting>

evaluates to <literal>"Foo"</literal>.  It is possible to provide a
default value in an attribute selection using the
<literal>or</literal> keyword.  For example,

<programlisting>
{ a = "Foo"; b = "Bar"; }.c or "Xyzzy"</programlisting>

will evaluate to <literal>"Xyzzy"</literal> because there is no
<varname>c</varname> attribute in the set.</para>

<para>You can use arbitrary double-quoted strings as attribute
names:

<programlisting>
{ "foo ${bar}" = 123; "nix-1.0" = 456; }."foo ${bar}"
</programlisting>

This will evaluate to <literal>123</literal> (Assuming
<literal>bar</literal> is antiquotable). In the case where an
attribute name is just a single antiquotation, the quotes can be
dropped:

<programlisting>
{ foo = 123; }.${bar} or 456 </programlisting>

This will evaluate to <literal>123</literal> if
<literal>bar</literal> evaluates to <literal>"foo"</literal> when
coerced to a string and <literal>456</literal> otherwise (again
assuming <literal>bar</literal> is antiquotable).</para>

<para>In the special case where an attribute name inside of a set declaration
evaluates to <literal>null</literal> (which is normally an error, as
<literal>null</literal> is not antiquotable), that attribute is simply not
added to the set:

<programlisting>
{ ${if foo then "bar" else null} = true; }</programlisting>

This will evaluate to <literal>{}</literal> if <literal>foo</literal>
evaluates to <literal>false</literal>.</para>

<para>A set that has a <literal>__functor</literal> attribute whose value
is callable (i.e. is itself a function or a set with a
<literal>__functor</literal> attribute whose value is callable) can be
applied as if it were a function, with the set itself passed in first
, e.g.,

<programlisting>
let add = { __functor = self: x: x + self.x; };
    inc = add // { x = 1; };
in inc 1
</programlisting>

evaluates to <literal>2</literal>. This can be used to attach metadata to a
function without the caller needing to treat it specially, or to implement
a form of object-oriented programming, for example.

</para>

<title>Language Constructs</title>

<simplesect><title>Recursive sets</title>

<para>Recursive sets are just normal sets, but the attributes can
refer to each other.  For example,

<programlisting>
rec {
  x = y;
  y = 123;
}.x
</programlisting>

evaluates to <literal>123</literal>.  Note that without
<literal>rec</literal> the binding <literal>x = y;</literal> would
refer to the variable <varname>y</varname> in the surrounding scope,
if one exists, and would be invalid if no such variable exists.  That
is, in a normal (non-recursive) set, attributes are not added to the
lexical scope; in a recursive set, they are.</para>

<para>Recursive sets of course introduce the danger of infinite
recursion.  For example,

<programlisting>
rec {
  x = y;
  y = x;
}.x</programlisting>

does not terminate<footnote><para>Actually, Nix detects infinite
recursion in this case and aborts (<quote>infinite recursion
encountered</quote>).</para></footnote>.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect xml:id="sect-let-expressions"><title>Let-expressions</title>

<para>A let-expression allows you to define local variables for an
expression.  For instance,

<programlisting>
let
  x = "foo";
  y = "bar";
in x + y</programlisting>

evaluates to <literal>"foobar"</literal>.

</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Inheriting attributes</title>

<para>When defining a set or in a let-expression it is often convenient to copy variables
from the surrounding lexical scope (e.g., when you want to propagate
attributes).  This can be shortened using the
<literal>inherit</literal> keyword.  For instance,

<programlisting>
let x = 123; in
{ inherit x;
  y = 456;
}</programlisting>

is equivalent to

<programlisting>
let x = 123; in
{ x = x;
  y = 456;
}</programlisting>

and both evaluate to <literal>{ x = 123; y = 456; }</literal>. (Note that
this works because <varname>x</varname> is added to the lexical scope
by the <literal>let</literal> construct.)  It is also possible to
inherit attributes from another set.  For instance, in this fragment
from <filename>all-packages.nix</filename>,

<programlisting>
  graphviz = (import ../tools/graphics/graphviz) {
    inherit fetchurl stdenv libpng libjpeg expat x11 yacc;
    inherit (xlibs) libXaw;
  };

  xlibs = {
    libX11 = ...;
    libXaw = ...;
    ...
  }

  libpng = ...;
  libjpg = ...;
  ...</programlisting>

the set used in the function call to the function defined in
<filename>../tools/graphics/graphviz</filename> inherits a number of
variables from the surrounding scope (<varname>fetchurl</varname>
... <varname>yacc</varname>), but also inherits
<varname>libXaw</varname> (the X Athena Widgets) from the
<varname>xlibs</varname> (X11 client-side libraries) set.</para>

<para>
Summarizing the fragment

<programlisting>
...
inherit x y z;
inherit (src-set) a b c;
...</programlisting>

is equivalent to

<programlisting>
...
x = x; y = y; z = z;
a = src-set.a; b = src-set.b; c = src-set.c;
...</programlisting>

when used while defining local variables in a let-expression or
while defining a set.</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect xml:id="ss-functions"><title>Functions</title>

<para>Functions have the following form:

<programlisting>
<replaceable>pattern</replaceable>: <replaceable>body</replaceable></programlisting>

The pattern specifies what the argument of the function must look
like, and binds variables in the body to (parts of) the
argument.  There are three kinds of patterns:</para>

<itemizedlist>


  <listitem><para>If a pattern is a single identifier, then the
  function matches any argument.  Example:

  <programlisting>
let negate = x: !x;
    concat = x: y: x + y;
in if negate true then concat "foo" "bar" else ""</programlisting>

  Note that <function>concat</function> is a function that takes one
  argument and returns a function that takes another argument.  This
  allows partial parameterisation (i.e., only filling some of the
  arguments of a function); e.g.,

  <programlisting>
map (concat "foo") [ "bar" "bla" "abc" ]</programlisting>

  evaluates to <literal>[ "foobar" "foobla"
  "fooabc" ]</literal>.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>A <emphasis>set pattern</emphasis> of the form
  <literal>{ name1, name2, &#x2026;, nameN }</literal> matches a set
  containing the listed attributes, and binds the values of those
  attributes to variables in the function body.  For example, the
  function

<programlisting>
{ x, y, z }: z + y + x</programlisting>

  can only be called with a set containing exactly the attributes
  <varname>x</varname>, <varname>y</varname> and
  <varname>z</varname>.  No other attributes are allowed.  If you want
  to allow additional arguments, you can use an ellipsis
  (<literal>...</literal>):

<programlisting>
{ x, y, z, ... }: z + y + x</programlisting>

  This works on any set that contains at least the three named
  attributes.</para>

  <para>It is possible to provide <emphasis>default values</emphasis>
  for attributes, in which case they are allowed to be missing.  A
  default value is specified by writing
  <literal><replaceable>name</replaceable> ?
  <replaceable>e</replaceable></literal>, where
  <replaceable>e</replaceable> is an arbitrary expression.  For example,

<programlisting>
{ x, y ? "foo", z ? "bar" }: z + y + x</programlisting>

  specifies a function that only requires an attribute named
  <varname>x</varname>, but optionally accepts <varname>y</varname>
  and <varname>z</varname>.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>An <literal>@</literal>-pattern provides a means of referring
  to the whole value being matched:

<programlisting> args@{ x, y, z, ... }: z + y + x + args.a</programlisting>

but can also be written as:

<programlisting> { x, y, z, ... } @ args: z + y + x + args.a</programlisting>

  Here <varname>args</varname> is bound to the entire argument, which
  is further matched against the pattern <literal>{ x, y, z,
  ... }</literal>. <literal>@</literal>-pattern makes mainly sense with an 
  ellipsis(<literal>...</literal>) as you can access attribute names as 
  <literal>a</literal>, using <literal>args.a</literal>, which was given as an
  additional attribute to the function.
  </para>

  <warning>
   <para>
    The <literal>args@</literal> expression is bound to the argument passed to the function which
    means that attributes with defaults that aren't explicitly specified in the function call
    won't cause an evaluation error, but won't exist in <literal>args</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    For instance
<programlisting>
let
  function = args@{ a ? 23, ... }: args;
in
 function {}
</programlisting>
    will evaluate to an empty attribute set.
   </para>
  </warning></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>Note that functions do not have names.  If you want to give them
a name, you can bind them to an attribute, e.g.,

<programlisting>
let concat = { x, y }: x + y;
in concat { x = "foo"; y = "bar"; }</programlisting>

</para>

<simplesect><title>Conditionals</title>

<para>Conditionals look like this:

<programlisting>
if <replaceable>e1</replaceable> then <replaceable>e2</replaceable> else <replaceable>e3</replaceable></programlisting>

where <replaceable>e1</replaceable> is an expression that should
evaluate to a Boolean value (<literal>true</literal> or
<literal>false</literal>).</para>

</simplesect>


<simplesect><title>Assertions</title>

<para>Assertions are generally used to check that certain requirements
on or between features and dependencies hold.  They look like this:

<programlisting>
assert <replaceable>e1</replaceable>; <replaceable>e2</replaceable></programlisting>

where <replaceable>e1</replaceable> is an expression that should
evaluate to a Boolean value.  If it evaluates to
<literal>true</literal>, <replaceable>e2</replaceable> is returned;
otherwise expression evaluation is aborted and a backtrace is printed.</para>

<para><xref linkend="ex-subversion-nix"/> show how assertions are
used in the Nix expression for Subversion.</para>

<calloutlist>

  <callout arearefs="ex-subversion-nix-co-1">
    <para>This assertion states that if Subversion is to have support
    for local repositories, then Berkeley DB is needed.  So if the
    Subversion function is called with the
    <varname>localServer</varname> argument set to
    <literal>true</literal> but the <varname>db4</varname> argument
    set to <literal>null</literal>, then the evaluation fails.</para>
  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-subversion-nix-co-2">
    <para>This is a more subtle condition: if Subversion is built with
    Apache (<literal>httpServer</literal>) support, then the Expat
    library (an XML library) used by Subversion should be same as the
    one used by Apache.  This is because in this configuration
    Subversion code ends up being linked with Apache code, and if the
    Expat libraries do not match, a build- or runtime link error or
    incompatibility might occur.</para>
  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-subversion-nix-co-3">
    <para>This assertion says that in order for Subversion to have SSL
    support (so that it can access <literal>https</literal> URLs), an
    OpenSSL library must be passed.  Additionally, it says that
    <emphasis>if</emphasis> Apache support is enabled, then Apache's
    OpenSSL should match Subversion's.  (Note that if Apache support
    is not enabled, we don't care about Apache's OpenSSL.)</para>
  </callout>

  <callout arearefs="ex-subversion-nix-co-4">
    <para>The conditional here is not really related to assertions,
    but is worth pointing out: it ensures that if SSL support is
    disabled, then the Subversion derivation is not dependent on
    OpenSSL, even if a non-<literal>null</literal> value was passed.
    This prevents an unnecessary rebuild of Subversion if OpenSSL
    changes.</para>

<simplesect><title>With-expressions</title>

<para>A <emphasis>with-expression</emphasis>,

<programlisting>
with <replaceable>e1</replaceable>; <replaceable>e2</replaceable></programlisting>

introduces the set <replaceable>e1</replaceable> into the lexical
scope of the expression <replaceable>e2</replaceable>.  For instance,

<programlisting>
let as = { x = "foo"; y = "bar"; };
in with as; x + y</programlisting>

evaluates to <literal>"foobar"</literal> since the
<literal>with</literal> adds the <varname>x</varname> and
<varname>y</varname> attributes of <varname>as</varname> to the
lexical scope in the expression <literal>x + y</literal>.  The most
common use of <literal>with</literal> is in conjunction with the
<function>import</function> function.  E.g.,

<programlisting>
with (import ./definitions.nix); ...</programlisting>

makes all attributes defined in the file
<filename>definitions.nix</filename> available as if they were defined
locally in a <literal>let</literal>-expression.</para>

<para>The bindings introduced by <literal>with</literal> do not shadow bindings
introduced by other means, e.g.

<programlisting>
let a = 3; in with { a = 1; }; let a = 4; in with { a = 2; }; ...</programlisting>

establishes the same scope as

<programlisting>
let a = 1; in let a = 2; in let a = 3; in let a = 4; in ...</programlisting>

<title>Derivations</title>

<para>The most important built-in function is
<function>derivation</function>, which is used to describe a single
derivation (a build action).  It takes as input a set, the attributes
of which specify the inputs of the build.</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem xml:id="attr-system"><para>There must be an attribute named
  <varname>system</varname> whose value must be a string specifying a
  Nix platform identifier, such as <literal>"i686-linux"</literal> or
  <literal>"x86_64-darwin"</literal><footnote><para>To figure out
  your platform identifier, look at the line <quote>Checking for the
  canonical Nix system name</quote> in the output of Nix's
  <filename>configure</filename> script.</para></footnote> The build
  can only be performed on a machine and operating system matching the
  platform identifier.  (Nix can automatically forward builds for
  other platforms by forwarding them to other machines; see <xref linkend="chap-distributed-builds"/>.)</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>There must be an attribute named
  <varname>name</varname> whose value must be a string.  This is used
  as a symbolic name for the package by <command>nix-env</command>,
  and it is appended to the output paths of the
  derivation.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>There must be an attribute named
  <varname>builder</varname> that identifies the program that is
  executed to perform the build.  It can be either a derivation or a
  source (a local file reference, e.g.,
  <filename>./builder.sh</filename>).</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Every attribute is passed as an environment variable
  to the builder.  Attribute values are translated to environment
  variables as follows:

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>Strings and numbers are just passed
      verbatim.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>A <emphasis>path</emphasis> (e.g.,
      <filename>../foo/sources.tar</filename>) causes the referenced
      file to be copied to the store; its location in the store is put
      in the environment variable.  The idea is that all sources
      should reside in the Nix store, since all inputs to a derivation
      should reside in the Nix store.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>A <emphasis>derivation</emphasis> causes that
      derivation to be built prior to the present derivation; its
      default output path is put in the environment
      variable.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Lists of the previous types are also allowed.
      They are simply concatenated, separated by
      spaces.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><literal>true</literal> is passed as the string
      <literal>1</literal>, <literal>false</literal> and
      <literal>null</literal> are passed as an empty string.
      </para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  </para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The optional attribute <varname>args</varname>
  specifies command-line arguments to be passed to the builder.  It
  should be a list.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The optional attribute <varname>outputs</varname>
  specifies a list of symbolic outputs of the derivation.  By default,
  a derivation produces a single output path, denoted as
  <literal>out</literal>.  However, derivations can produce multiple
  output paths.  This is useful because it allows outputs to be
  downloaded or garbage-collected separately.  For instance, imagine a
  library package that provides a dynamic library, header files, and
  documentation.  A program that links against the library doesn&#x2019;t
  need the header files and documentation at runtime, and it doesn&#x2019;t
  need the documentation at build time.  Thus, the library package
  could specify:
<programlisting>
outputs = [ "lib" "headers" "doc" ];
</programlisting>
  This will cause Nix to pass environment variables
  <literal>lib</literal>, <literal>headers</literal> and
  <literal>doc</literal> to the builder containing the intended store
  paths of each output.  The builder would typically do something like
<programlisting>
./configure --libdir=$lib/lib --includedir=$headers/include --docdir=$doc/share/doc
</programlisting>
  for an Autoconf-style package.  You can refer to each output of a
  derivation by selecting it as an attribute, e.g.
<programlisting>
buildInputs = [ pkg.lib pkg.headers ];
</programlisting>
  The first element of <varname>outputs</varname> determines the
  <emphasis>default output</emphasis>.  Thus, you could also write
<programlisting>
buildInputs = [ pkg pkg.headers ];
</programlisting>
  since <literal>pkg</literal> is equivalent to
  <literal>pkg.lib</literal>.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>The function <function>mkDerivation</function> in the Nixpkgs
standard environment is a wrapper around
<function>derivation</function> that adds a default value for
<varname>system</varname> and always uses Bash as the builder, to
which the supplied builder is passed as a command-line argument.  See
the Nixpkgs manual for details.</para>

<para>The builder is executed as follows:

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>A temporary directory is created under the directory
  specified by <envar>TMPDIR</envar> (default
  <filename>/tmp</filename>) where the build will take place.  The
  current directory is changed to this directory.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The environment is cleared and set to the derivation
  attributes, as specified above.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>In addition, the following variables are set:

  <itemizedlist>

    <listitem><para><envar>NIX_BUILD_TOP</envar> contains the path of
    the temporary directory for this build.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Also, <envar>TMPDIR</envar>,
    <envar>TEMPDIR</envar>, <envar>TMP</envar>, <envar>TEMP</envar>
    are set to point to the temporary directory.  This is to prevent
    the builder from accidentally writing temporary files anywhere
    else.  Doing so might cause interference by other
    processes.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para><envar>PATH</envar> is set to
    <filename>/path-not-set</filename> to prevent shells from
    initialising it to their built-in default value.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para><envar>HOME</envar> is set to
    <filename>/homeless-shelter</filename> to prevent programs from
    using <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> or the like to find the
    user's home directory, which could cause impurity.  Usually, when
    <envar>HOME</envar> is set, it is used as the location of the home
    directory, even if it points to a non-existent
    path.</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para><envar>NIX_STORE</envar> is set to the path of the
    top-level Nix store directory (typically,

<title>Advanced Attributes</title>

<para>Derivations can declare some infrequently used optional
attributes.</para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-allowedReferences"><term><varname>allowedReferences</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>The optional attribute
    <varname>allowedReferences</varname> specifies a list of legal
    references (dependencies) of the output of the builder.  For
    example,

<programlisting>
allowedReferences = [];
</programlisting>

    enforces that the output of a derivation cannot have any runtime
    dependencies on its inputs.  To allow an output to have a runtime
    dependency on itself, use <literal>"out"</literal> as a list item.
    This is used in NixOS to check that generated files such as
    initial ramdisks for booting Linux don&#x2019;t have accidental
    dependencies on other paths in the Nix store.</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-allowedRequisites"><term><varname>allowedRequisites</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>This attribute is similar to
    <varname>allowedReferences</varname>, but it specifies the legal
    requisites of the whole closure, so all the dependencies
    recursively.  For example,

<programlisting>
allowedRequisites = [ foobar ];
</programlisting>

    enforces that the output of a derivation cannot have any other
    runtime dependency than <varname>foobar</varname>, and in addition
    it enforces that <varname>foobar</varname> itself doesn't
    introduce any other dependency itself.</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-disallowedReferences"><term><varname>disallowedReferences</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>The optional attribute
    <varname>disallowedReferences</varname> specifies a list of illegal
    references (dependencies) of the output of the builder.  For
    example,

<programlisting>
disallowedReferences = [ foo ];
</programlisting>

    enforces that the output of a derivation cannot have a direct runtime
    dependencies on the derivation <varname>foo</varname>.</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-disallowedRequisites"><term><varname>disallowedRequisites</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>This attribute is similar to

    requisites for the whole closure, so all the dependencies
    recursively.  For example,

<programlisting>

  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-exportReferencesGraph"><term><varname>exportReferencesGraph</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>This attribute allows builders access to the
    references graph of their inputs.  The attribute is a list of
    inputs in the Nix store whose references graph the builder needs
    to know.  The value of this attribute should be a list of pairs
    <literal>[ <replaceable>name1</replaceable>
    <replaceable>path1</replaceable> <replaceable>name2</replaceable>
    <replaceable>path2</replaceable> <replaceable>...</replaceable>
    ]</literal>.  The references graph of each
    <replaceable>pathN</replaceable> will be stored in a text file
    <replaceable>nameN</replaceable> in the temporary build directory.
    The text files have the format used by <command>nix-store
    --register-validity</command> (with the deriver fields left
    empty).  For example, when the following derivation is built:

<programlisting>
derivation {
  ...
  exportReferencesGraph = [ "libfoo-graph" libfoo ];
};
</programlisting>

    the references graph of <literal>libfoo</literal> is placed in the
    file <filename>libfoo-graph</filename> in the temporary build
    directory.</para>

    <para><varname>exportReferencesGraph</varname> is useful for
    builders that want to do something with the closure of a store
    path.  Examples include the builders in NixOS that generate the
    initial ramdisk for booting Linux (a <command>cpio</command>
    archive containing the closure of the boot script) and the
    ISO-9660 image for the installation CD (which is populated with a
    Nix store containing the closure of a bootable NixOS
    configuration).</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-impureEnvVars"><term><varname>impureEnvVars</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>This attribute allows you to specify a list of
    environment variables that should be passed from the environment
    of the calling user to the builder.  Usually, the environment is
    cleared completely when the builder is executed, but with this
    attribute you can allow specific environment variables to be
    passed unmodified.  For example, <function>fetchurl</function> in
    Nixpkgs has the line

<programlisting>
impureEnvVars = [ "http_proxy" "https_proxy" <replaceable>...</replaceable> ];
</programlisting>

    to make it use the proxy server configuration specified by the
    user in the environment variables <envar>http_proxy</envar> and
    friends.</para>

    <para>This attribute is only allowed in <link linkend="fixed-output-drvs">fixed-output derivations</link>, where
    impurities such as these are okay since (the hash of) the output
    is known in advance.  It is ignored for all other
    derivations.</para>

    <warning><para><varname>impureEnvVars</varname> implementation takes
    environment variables from the current builder process. When a daemon is
    building its environmental variables are used. Without the daemon, the
    environmental variables come from the environment of the
    <command>nix-build</command>.</para></warning></listitem>

  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry xml:id="fixed-output-drvs">
    <term xml:id="adv-attr-outputHash"><varname>outputHash</varname></term>
    <term xml:id="adv-attr-outputHashAlgo"><varname>outputHashAlgo</varname></term>
    <term xml:id="adv-attr-outputHashMode"><varname>outputHashMode</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>These attributes declare that the derivation is a
    so-called <emphasis>fixed-output derivation</emphasis>, which
    means that a cryptographic hash of the output is already known in
    advance.  When the build of a fixed-output derivation finishes,
    Nix computes the cryptographic hash of the output and compares it
    to the hash declared with these attributes.  If there is a
    mismatch, the build fails.</para>

    <para>The rationale for fixed-output derivations is derivations
    such as those produced by the <function>fetchurl</function>
    function.  This function downloads a file from a given URL.  To
    ensure that the downloaded file has not been modified, the caller
    must also specify a cryptographic hash of the file.  For example,

<programlisting>
fetchurl {
  url = "http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/hello/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz";
  sha256 = "1md7jsfd8pa45z73bz1kszpp01yw6x5ljkjk2hx7wl800any6465";
}
</programlisting>

    It sometimes happens that the URL of the file changes, e.g.,
    because servers are reorganised or no longer available.  We then
    must update the call to <function>fetchurl</function>, e.g.,

<programlisting>
fetchurl {
  url = "ftp://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/gnu/hello/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz";
  sha256 = "1md7jsfd8pa45z73bz1kszpp01yw6x5ljkjk2hx7wl800any6465";
}
</programlisting>

    If a <function>fetchurl</function> derivation was treated like a
    normal derivation, the output paths of the derivation and
    <emphasis>all derivations depending on it</emphasis> would change.
    For instance, if we were to change the URL of the Glibc source
    distribution in Nixpkgs (a package on which almost all other
    packages depend) massive rebuilds would be needed.  This is
    unfortunate for a change which we know cannot have a real effect
    as it propagates upwards through the dependency graph.</para>

    <para>For fixed-output derivations, on the other hand, the name of
    the output path only depends on the <varname>outputHash*</varname>
    and <varname>name</varname> attributes, while all other attributes
    are ignored for the purpose of computing the output path.  (The
    <varname>name</varname> attribute is included because it is part
    of the path.)</para>

    <para>As an example, here is the (simplified) Nix expression for
    <varname>fetchurl</varname>:

<programlisting>
{ stdenv, curl }: # The <command>curl</command> program is used for downloading.

{ url, sha256 }:

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = baseNameOf (toString url);
  builder = ./builder.sh;
  buildInputs = [ curl ];

  # This is a fixed-output derivation; the output must be a regular
  # file with SHA256 hash <varname>sha256</varname>.
  outputHashMode = "flat";
  outputHashAlgo = "sha256";
  outputHash = sha256;

  inherit url;
}
</programlisting>

    </para>

    <para>The <varname>outputHashAlgo</varname> attribute specifies
    the hash algorithm used to compute the hash.  It can currently be
    <literal>"sha1"</literal>, <literal>"sha256"</literal> or
    <literal>"sha512"</literal>.</para>

    <para>The <varname>outputHashMode</varname> attribute determines
    how the hash is computed.  It must be one of the following two
    values:

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry><term><literal>"flat"</literal></term>

        <listitem><para>The output must be a non-executable regular
        file.  If it isn&#x2019;t, the build fails.  The hash is simply
        computed over the contents of that file (so it&#x2019;s equal to what
        Unix commands like <command>sha256sum</command> or
        <command>sha1sum</command> produce).</para>

        <para>This is the default.</para></listitem>

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry><term><literal>"recursive"</literal></term>

        <listitem><para>The hash is computed over the NAR archive dump
        of the output (i.e., the result of <link linkend="refsec-nix-store-dump"><command>nix-store
        --dump</command></link>).  In this case, the output can be
        anything, including a directory tree.</para></listitem>

      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    </para>

    <para>The <varname>outputHash</varname> attribute, finally, must
    be a string containing the hash in either hexadecimal or base-32
    notation.  (See the <link linkend="sec-nix-hash"><command>nix-hash</command> command</link>
    for information about converting to and from base-32
    notation.)</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-passAsFile"><term><varname>passAsFile</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>A list of names of attributes that should be
    passed via files rather than environment variables.  For example,
    if you have

    <programlisting>
passAsFile = ["big"];
big = "a very long string";
    </programlisting>

    then when the builder runs, the environment variable
    <envar>bigPath</envar> will contain the absolute path to a
    temporary file containing <literal>a very long
    string</literal>. That is, for any attribute
    <replaceable>x</replaceable> listed in
    <varname>passAsFile</varname>, Nix will pass an environment
    variable <envar><replaceable>x</replaceable>Path</envar> holding
    the path of the file containing the value of attribute
    <replaceable>x</replaceable>. This is useful when you need to pass
    large strings to a builder, since most operating systems impose a
    limit on the size of the environment (typically, a few hundred
    kilobyte).</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-preferLocalBuild"><term><varname>preferLocalBuild</varname></term>

    <listitem><para>If this attribute is set to
    <literal>true</literal> and <link linkend="chap-distributed-builds">distributed building is
    enabled</link>, then, if possible, the derivaton will be built
    locally instead of forwarded to a remote machine.  This is
    appropriate for trivial builders where the cost of doing a
    download or remote build would exceed the cost of building
    locally.</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>


  <varlistentry xml:id="adv-attr-allowSubstitutes"><term><varname>allowSubstitutes</varname></term>

    <listitem>
    <para>If this attribute is set to
    <literal>false</literal>, then Nix will always build this
    derivation; it will not try to substitute its outputs. This is
    useful for very trivial derivations (such as
    <function>writeText</function> in Nixpkgs) that are cheaper to
    build than to substitute from a binary cache.</para>

    <note><para>You need to have a builder configured which satisfies
    the derivation&#x2019;s <literal>system</literal> attribute, since the
    derivation cannot be substituted. Thus it is usually a good idea
    to align <literal>system</literal> with
    <literal>builtins.currentSystem</literal> when setting
    <literal>allowSubstitutes</literal> to <literal>false</literal>.
    For most trivial derivations this should be the case.

<title>Built-in Functions</title>

<para>This section lists the functions and constants built into the
Nix expression evaluator.  (The built-in function
<function>derivation</function> is discussed above.)  Some built-ins,

polluting the namespace too much, most built-ins are not in scope.
Instead, you can access them through the <varname>builtins</varname>

    <literal>xz</literal>. The top-level path component of the files
    in the tarball is removed, so it is best if the tarball contains a
    single directory at top level. The typical use of the function is
    to obtain external Nix expression dependencies, such as a
    particular version of Nixpkgs, e.g.

<programlisting>
with import (fetchTarball https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-14.12.tar.gz) {};

    <para>The fetched tarball is cached for a certain amount of time

    You can change the cache timeout either on the command line with
    <option>--option tarball-ttl <replaceable>number of seconds</replaceable></option> or
    in the Nix configuration file with this option:
    <literal><xref linkend="conf-tarball-ttl"/> <replaceable>number of seconds to cache</replaceable></literal>.

    <para>Note that when obtaining the hash with <varname>nix-prefetch-url

    <para>This function can also verify the contents against a hash.

    requires the attribute <varname>url</varname> and the attribute
    <varname>sha256</varname>, e.g.

            It is nice to always specify the branch which a revision
            belongs to. Without the branch being specified, the
            fetcher might fail if the default branch changes.
            Additionally, it can be confusing to try a commit from a
            non-default branch and see the fetch fail. If the branch
            is specified the fault is much more obvious.

    <listitem>

      <para>This function allows you to copy sources into the Nix
      store while filtering certain files.  For instance, suppose that
      you want to use the directory <filename>source-dir</filename> as
      an input to a Nix expression, e.g.

<programlisting>
stdenv.mkDerivation {
  ...
  src = ./source-dir;
}
</programlisting>

      However, if <filename>source-dir</filename> is a Subversion
      working copy, then all those annoying <filename>.svn</filename>
      subdirectories will also be copied to the store.  Worse, the
      contents of those directories may change a lot, causing lots of
      spurious rebuilds.  With <function>filterSource</function> you
      can filter out the <filename>.svn</filename> directories:

<programlisting>
  src = builtins.filterSource
    (path: type: type != "directory" || baseNameOf path != ".svn")
    ./source-dir;
</programlisting>

      </para>

      <para>Thus, the first argument <replaceable>e1</replaceable>
      must be a predicate function that is called for each regular
      file, directory or symlink in the source tree
      <replaceable>e2</replaceable>.  If the function returns
      <literal>true</literal>, the file is copied to the Nix store,
      otherwise it is omitted.  The function is called with two
      arguments.  The first is the full path of the file.  The second
      is a string that identifies the type of the file, which is
      either <literal>"regular"</literal>,
      <literal>"directory"</literal>, <literal>"symlink"</literal> or
      <literal>"unknown"</literal> (for other kinds of files such as
      device nodes or fifos &#x2014; but note that those cannot be copied to
      the Nix store, so if the predicate returns
      <literal>true</literal> for them, the copy will fail). If you
      exclude a directory, the entire corresponding subtree of
      <replaceable>e2</replaceable> will be excluded.</para>

    <listitem><para>Return a string containing an XML representation
    of <replaceable>e</replaceable>.  The main application for
    <function>toXML</function> is to communicate information with the
    builder in a more structured format than plain environment
    variables.</para>

    <!-- TODO: more formally describe the schema of the XML
    representation -->

    <para><xref linkend="ex-toxml"/> shows an example where this is
    the case.  The builder is supposed to generate the configuration
    file for a <link xlink:href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/">Jetty
    servlet container</link>.  A servlet container contains a number
    of servlets (<filename>*.war</filename> files) each exported under
    a specific URI prefix.  So the servlet configuration is a list of
    sets containing the <varname>path</varname> and
    <varname>war</varname> of the servlet (<xref linkend="ex-toxml-co-servlets"/>).  This kind of information is
    difficult to communicate with the normal method of passing
    information through an environment variable, which just
    concatenates everything together into a string (which might just
    work in this case, but wouldn&#x2019;t work if fields are optional or
    contain lists themselves).  Instead the Nix expression is
    converted to an XML representation with
    <function>toXML</function>, which is unambiguous and can easily be
    processed with the appropriate tools.  For instance, in the
    example an XSLT stylesheet (<xref linkend="ex-toxml-co-stylesheet"/>) is applied to it (<xref linkend="ex-toxml-co-apply"/>) to
    generate the XML configuration file for the Jetty server.  The XML
    representation produced from <xref linkend="ex-toxml-co-servlets"/> by <function>toXML</function> is shown in <xref linkend="ex-toxml-result"/>.</para>

    <para>Note that <xref linkend="ex-toxml"/> uses the <function linkend="builtin-toFile">toFile</function> built-in to write the
    builder and the stylesheet &#x201C;inline&#x201D; in the Nix expression.  The
    path of the stylesheet is spliced into the builder at
    <literal>xsltproc ${stylesheet}

<title>Advanced Topics</title>

<chapter xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" version="5.0" xml:id="chap-distributed-builds">

<title>Remote Builds</title>

<para>Nix supports remote builds, where a local Nix installation can
forward Nix builds to other machines.  This allows multiple builds to
be performed in parallel and allows Nix to perform multi-platform
builds in a semi-transparent way.  For instance, if you perform a
build for a <literal>x86_64-darwin</literal> on an
<literal>i686-linux</literal> machine, Nix can automatically forward
the build to a <literal>x86_64-darwin</literal> machine, if
available.</para>

<para>To forward a build to a remote machine, it&#x2019;s required that the
remote machine is accessible via SSH and that it has Nix
installed. You can test whether connecting to the remote Nix instance
works, e.g.

<screen>
$ nix ping-store --store ssh://mac
</screen>

will try to connect to the machine named <literal>mac</literal>. It is
possible to specify an SSH identity file as part of the remote store
URI, e.g.

<screen>
$ nix ping-store --store ssh://mac?ssh-key=/home/alice/my-key
</screen>

Since builds should be non-interactive, the key should not have a
passphrase. Alternatively, you can load identities ahead of time into
<command>ssh-agent</command> or <command>gpg-agent</command>.</para>

<para>If you get the error

<screen>
bash: nix-store: command not found
error: cannot connect to 'mac'
</screen>

then you need to ensure that the <envar>PATH</envar> of
non-interactive login shells contains Nix.</para>

<warning><para>If you are building via the Nix daemon, it is the Nix
daemon user account (that is, <literal>root</literal>) that should
have SSH access to the remote machine. If you can&#x2019;t or don&#x2019;t want to
configure <literal>root</literal> to be able to access to remote
machine, you can use a private Nix store instead by passing
e.g. <literal>--store ~/my-nix</literal>.</para></warning>

<para>The list of remote machines can be specified on the command line
or in the Nix configuration file. The former is convenient for
testing. For example, the following command allows you to build a
derivation for <literal>x86_64-darwin</literal> on a Linux machine:

<screen>
$ uname
Linux

$ nix build \
  '(with import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; { system = "x86_64-darwin"; }; runCommand "foo" {} "uname &gt; $out")' \
  --builders 'ssh://mac x86_64-darwin'
[1/0/1 built, 0.0 MiB DL] building foo on ssh://mac

$ cat ./result
Darwin
</screen>

It is possible to specify multiple builders separated by a semicolon
or a newline, e.g.

<screen>
  --builders 'ssh://mac x86_64-darwin ; ssh://beastie x86_64-freebsd'
</screen>
</para>

<para>Each machine specification consists of the following elements,
separated by spaces. Only the first element is required.
To leave a field at its default, set it to <literal>-</literal>.

<orderedlist>

  <listitem><para>The URI of the remote store in the format
  <literal>ssh://[<replaceable>username</replaceable>@]<replaceable>hostname</replaceable></literal>,
  e.g. <literal>ssh://nix@mac</literal> or
  <literal>ssh://mac</literal>. For backward compatibility,
  <literal>ssh://</literal> may be omitted. The hostname may be an
  alias defined in your
  <filename>~/.ssh/config</filename>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>A comma-separated list of Nix platform type
  identifiers, such as <literal>x86_64-darwin</literal>.  It is
  possible for a machine to support multiple platform types, e.g.,
  <literal>i686-linux,x86_64-linux</literal>. If omitted, this
  defaults to the local platform type.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The SSH identity file to be used to log in to the
  remote machine. If omitted, SSH will use its regular
  identities.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The maximum number of builds that Nix will execute
  in parallel on the machine.  Typically this should be equal to the
  number of CPU cores.  For instance, the machine
  <literal>itchy</literal> in the example will execute up to 8 builds
  in parallel.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The &#x201C;speed factor&#x201D;, indicating the relative speed of
  the machine.  If there are multiple machines of the right type, Nix
  will prefer the fastest, taking load into account.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>A comma-separated list of <emphasis>supported
  features</emphasis>.  If a derivation has the
  <varname>requiredSystemFeatures</varname> attribute, then Nix will
  only perform the derivation on a machine that has the specified
  features.  For instance, the attribute

<programlisting>
requiredSystemFeatures = [ "kvm" ];
</programlisting>

  will cause the build to be performed on a machine that has the
  <literal>kvm</literal> feature.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>A comma-separated list of <emphasis>mandatory
  features</emphasis>.  A machine will only be used to build a
  derivation if all of the machine&#x2019;s mandatory features appear in the
  derivation&#x2019;s <varname>requiredSystemFeatures</varname>
  attribute..</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>

For example, the machine specification

<programlisting>
nix@scratchy.labs.cs.uu.nl  i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        8 1 kvm
nix@itchy.labs.cs.uu.nl     i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        8 2
nix@poochie.labs.cs.uu.nl   i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        1 2 kvm benchmark
</programlisting>

specifies several machines that can perform
<literal>i686-linux</literal> builds. However,
<literal>poochie</literal> will only do builds that have the attribute

<programlisting>
requiredSystemFeatures = [ "benchmark" ];
</programlisting>

or

<programlisting>
requiredSystemFeatures = [ "benchmark" "kvm" ];
</programlisting>

<literal>itchy</literal> cannot do builds that require
<literal>kvm</literal>, but <literal>scratchy</literal> does support
such builds. For regular builds, <literal>itchy</literal> will be
preferred over <literal>scratchy</literal> because it has a higher
speed factor.</para>

<para>Remote builders can also be configured in
<filename>nix.conf</filename>, e.g.

<programlisting>
builders = ssh://mac x86_64-darwin ; ssh://beastie x86_64-freebsd
</programlisting>

Finally, remote builders can be configured in a separate configuration
file included in <option>builders</option> via the syntax
<literal>@<replaceable>file</replaceable></literal>. For example,

<programlisting>
builders = @/etc/nix/machines
</programlisting>

causes the list of machines in <filename>/etc/nix/machines</filename>
to be included. (This is the default.)</para>

<para>If you want the builders to use caches, you likely want to set
the option <link linkend="conf-builders-use-substitutes"><literal>builders-use-substitutes</literal></link>
in your local <filename>nix.conf</filename>.</para>

<para>To build only on remote builders and disable building on the local machine,
you can use the option <option>--max-jobs 0</option>.</para>

<title>Tuning Cores and Jobs</title>

<para>Nix has two relevant settings with regards to how your CPU cores
will be utilized: <xref linkend="conf-cores"/> and
<xref linkend="conf-max-jobs"/>. This chapter will talk about what
they are, how they interact, and their configuration trade-offs.</para>

<variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
    <term><xref linkend="conf-max-jobs"/></term>
    <listitem><para>
      Dictates how many separate derivations will be built at the same
      time. If you set this to zero, the local machine will do no
      builds. Nix will still substitute from binary caches, and build
      remotely if remote builders are configured.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
    <term><xref linkend="conf-cores"/></term>
    <listitem><para>
      Suggests how many cores each derivation should use. Similar to
      <command>make -j</command>.
    </para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>The <xref linkend="conf-cores"/> setting determines the value of
<envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar>. <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar> is equal
to <xref linkend="conf-cores"/>, unless <xref linkend="conf-cores"/>
equals <literal>0</literal>, in which case <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar>
will be the total number of cores in the system.</para>

<para>The maximum number of consumed cores is a simple multiplication,
<xref linkend="conf-max-jobs"/> * <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar>.</para>

<para>The balance on how to set these two independent variables depends
upon each builder's workload and hardware. Here are a few example
scenarios on a machine with 24 cores:</para>

    <xref linkend="ssec-s3-substituter-authenticated-writes"/>, and
    that the <literal>root</literal> user's default AWS profile can
    upload to the bucket.
  </para>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Set up a Signing Key</title>
  <para>Use <command>nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key</command> to
  create our public and private signing keys. We will sign paths
  with the private key, and distribute the public key for verifying
  the authenticity of the paths.</para>

  <screen>
# nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key example-nix-cache-1 /etc/nix/key.private /etc/nix/key.public
# cat /etc/nix/key.public
example-nix-cache-1:1/cKDz3QCCOmwcztD2eV6Coggp6rqc9DGjWv7C0G+rM=
</screen>

<para>Then, add the public key and the cache URL to your
<filename>nix.conf</filename>'s <xref linkend="conf-trusted-public-keys"/>
and <xref linkend="conf-substituters"/> like:</para>

<programlisting>
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org/ s3://example-nix-cache
trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY= example-nix-cache-1:1/cKDz3QCCOmwcztD2eV6Coggp6rqc9DGjWv7C0G+rM=
</programlisting>

<para>We will restart the Nix daemon in a later step.</para>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Implementing the build hook</title>
  <para>Write the following script to
  <filename>/etc/nix/upload-to-cache.sh</filename>:
  </para>

  <programlisting>
#!/bin/sh

set -eu
set -f # disable globbing
export IFS=' '

echo "Signing paths" $OUT_PATHS
nix sign-paths --key-file /etc/nix/key.private $OUT_PATHS
echo "Uploading paths" $OUT_PATHS
exec nix copy --to 's3://example-nix-cache' $OUT_PATHS
</programlisting>

  <note>
    <title>Should <literal>$OUT_PATHS</literal> be quoted?</title>
    <para>
      The <literal>$OUT_PATHS</literal> variable is a space-separated
      list of Nix store paths. In this case, we expect and want the
      shell to perform word splitting to make each output path its
      own argument to <command>nix sign-paths</command>. Nix guarantees
      the paths will not contain any spaces, however a store path
      might contain glob characters. The <command>set -f</command>
      disables globbing in the shell.
    </para>
  </note>
  <para>
    Then make sure the hook program is executable by the <literal>root</literal> user:
    <screen>
# chmod +x /etc/nix/upload-to-cache.sh
</screen></para>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Updating Nix Configuration</title>

  <para>Edit <filename>/etc/nix/nix.conf</filename> to run our hook,
  by adding the following configuration snippet at the end:</para>

  <programlisting>
post-build-hook = /etc/nix/upload-to-cache.sh
</programlisting>

<para>Then, restart the <command>nix-daemon</command>.</para>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Testing</title>

  <para>Build any derivation, for example:</para>

  <screen>
$ nix-build -E '(import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}).writeText "example" (builtins.toString builtins.currentTime)'
this derivation will be built:
  /nix/store/s4pnfbkalzy5qz57qs6yybna8wylkig6-example.drv
building '/nix/store/s4pnfbkalzy5qz57qs6yybna8wylkig6-example.drv'...
running post-build-hook '/home/grahamc/projects/github.com/NixOS/nix/post-hook.sh'...

/nix/store/ibcyipq5gf91838ldx40mjsp0b8w9n18-example
</screen>

  <para>Then delete the path from the store, and try substituting it from the binary cache:</para>
  <screen>
$ rm ./result
$ nix-store --delete /nix/store/ibcyipq5gf91838ldx40mjsp0b8w9n18-example
</screen>

<para>Now, copy the path back from the cache:</para>
<screen>
$ nix-store --realise /nix/store/ibcyipq5gf91838ldx40mjsp0b8w9n18-example
copying path '/nix/store/m8bmqwrch6l3h8s0k3d673xpmipcdpsa-example from 's3://example-nix-cache'...
warning: you did not specify '--add-root'; the result might be removed by the garbage collector
/nix/store/m8bmqwrch6l3h8s0k3d673xpmipcdpsa-example
</screen>
</section>
<section>
  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <para>
    We now have a Nix installation configured to automatically sign and
    upload every local build to a remote binary cache.

<chapter xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="sec-common-options">

<title>Common Options</title>


<para>Most Nix commands accept the following command-line options:</para>

<variablelist xml:id="opt-common">

<varlistentry><term><option>--help</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Prints out a summary of the command syntax and
  exits.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--version</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Prints out the Nix version number on standard output
  and exits.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--verbose</option> / <option>-v</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Increases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages
  printed on standard error.  For each Nix operation, the information
  printed on standard output is well-defined; any diagnostic
  information is printed on standard error, never on standard
  output.</para>

  <para>This option may be specified repeatedly.  Currently, the
  following verbosity levels exist:</para>

  <variablelist>

    <varlistentry><term>0</term>
    <listitem><para>&#x201C;Errors only&#x201D;: only print messages
    explaining why the Nix invocation failed.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry><term>1</term>
    <listitem><para>&#x201C;Informational&#x201D;: print
    <emphasis>useful</emphasis> messages about what Nix is doing.
    This is the default.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry><term>2</term>
    <listitem><para>&#x201C;Talkative&#x201D;: print more informational
    messages.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry><term>3</term>
    <listitem><para>&#x201C;Chatty&#x201D;: print even more
    informational messages.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry><term>4</term>
    <listitem><para>&#x201C;Debug&#x201D;: print debug

    <listitem><para>&#x201C;Vomit&#x201D;: print vast amounts of debug
    information.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

  </variablelist>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--quiet</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Decreases the level of verbosity of diagnostic messages
  printed on standard error.  This is the inverse option to
  <option>-v</option> / <option>--verbose</option>.
  </para>

  <para>This option may be specified repeatedly.  See the previous
  verbosity levels list.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry xml:id="opt-log-format"><term><option>--log-format</option> <replaceable>format</replaceable></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>This option can be used to change the output of the log format, with
  <replaceable>format</replaceable> being one of:</para>

  <variablelist>

    <varlistentry><term>raw</term>
    <listitem><para>This is the raw format, as outputted by nix-build.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <listitem><para>Only display a progress bar during the builds.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry><term>bar-with-logs</term>
    <listitem><para>Display the raw logs, with the progress bar at the bottom.</para></listitem>
    </varlistentry>

  </variablelist>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><option>--no-build-output</option> / <option>-Q</option></term>

  <listitem><para>By default, output written by builders to standard
  output and standard error is echoed to the Nix command's standard
  error.  This option suppresses this behaviour.  Note that the
  builder's standard output and error are always written to a log file
  in
  <filename><replaceable>prefix</replaceable>/nix/var/log/nix</filename>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry xml:id="opt-max-jobs"><term><option>--max-jobs</option> / <option>-j</option>
<replaceable>number</replaceable></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Sets the maximum number of build jobs that Nix will
  perform in parallel to the specified number.  Specify
  <literal>auto</literal> to use the number of CPUs in the system.
  The default is specified by the <link linkend="conf-max-jobs"><literal>max-jobs</literal></link>
  configuration setting, which itself defaults to
  <literal>1</literal>.  A higher value is useful on SMP systems or to
  exploit I/O latency.</para>

  <para> Setting it to <literal>0</literal> disallows building on the local
  machine, which is useful when you want builds to happen only on remote
  builders.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry xml:id="opt-cores"><term><option>--cores</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Sets the value of the <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar>
  environment variable in the invocation of builders.  Builders can
  use this variable at their discretion to control the maximum amount
  of parallelism.  For instance, in Nixpkgs, if the derivation
  attribute <varname>enableParallelBuilding</varname> is set to
  <literal>true</literal>, the builder passes the
  <option>-j<replaceable>N</replaceable></option> flag to GNU Make.
  It defaults to the value of the <link linkend="conf-cores"><literal>cores</literal></link>
  configuration setting, if set, or <literal>1</literal> otherwise.
  The value <literal>0</literal> means that the builder should use all
  available CPU cores in the system.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry xml:id="opt-max-silent-time"><term><option>--max-silent-time</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder
  can go without producing any data on standard output or standard
  error.  The default is specified by the <link linkend="conf-max-silent-time"><literal>max-silent-time</literal></link>
  configuration setting.  <literal>0</literal> means no
  time-out.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry xml:id="opt-timeout"><term><option>--timeout</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder
  can run.  The default is specified by the <link linkend="conf-timeout"><literal>timeout</literal></link>
  configuration setting.  <literal>0</literal> means no
  timeout.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><option>--keep-going</option> / <option>-k</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Keep going in case of failed builds, to the
  greatest extent possible.  That is, if building an input of some
  derivation fails, Nix will still build the other inputs, but not the
  derivation itself.  Without this option, Nix stops if any build
  fails (except for builds of substitutes), possibly killing builds in
  progress (in case of parallel or distributed builds).</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--keep-failed</option> / <option>-K</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Specifies that in case of a build failure, the
  temporary directory (usually in <filename>/tmp</filename>) in which
  the build takes place should not be deleted.  The path of the build
  directory is printed as an informational message.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--fallback</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which
  substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output
  paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the
  derivation.</para>

  <para>The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we
  have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution
  from, say, a network repository.  If the repository is down, the
  realisation of the derivation will fail.  When this option is
  specified, Nix will build the derivation instead.  Thus,
  installation from binaries falls back on installation from source.
  This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable
  for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a
  full build from source (with the related consumption of
  resources).</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry><term><option>--no-build-hook</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Disables the build hook mechanism.  This allows to ignore remote
  builders if they are setup on the machine.</para>

  <para>It's useful in cases where the bandwidth between the client and the
  remote builder is too low.  In that case it can take more time to upload the
  sources to the remote builder and fetch back the result than to do the
  computation locally.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry>



<varlistentry><term><option>--readonly-mode</option></term>

  <listitem><para>When this option is used, no attempt is made to open
  the Nix database.  Most Nix operations do need database access, so
  those operations will fail.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--arg</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is accepted by
  <command>nix-env</command>, <command>nix-instantiate</command>,
  <command>nix-shell</command> and <command>nix-build</command>.
  When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will
  automatically try to call functions that
  it encounters.  It can automatically call functions for which every
  argument has a <link linkend="ss-functions">default value</link>
  (e.g., <literal>{ <replaceable>argName</replaceable> ?
  <replaceable>defaultValue</replaceable> }:
  <replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>).  With
  <option>--arg</option>, you can also call functions that have
  arguments without a default value (or override a default value).
  That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument
  named <replaceable>name</replaceable>, it will call it with value
  <replaceable>value</replaceable>.</para>

  <para>For instance, the top-level <literal>default.nix</literal> in
  Nixpkgs is actually a function:

<programlisting>
{ # The system (e.g., `i686-linux') for which to build the packages.
  system ? builtins.currentSystem
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
}: <replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

  So if you call this Nix expression (e.g., when you do
  <literal>nix-env -i <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></literal>),
  the function will be called automatically using the value <link linkend="builtin-currentSystem"><literal>builtins.currentSystem</literal></link>
  for the <literal>system</literal> argument.  You can override this
  using <option>--arg</option>, e.g., <literal>nix-env -i
  <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable> --arg system
  \"i686-freebsd\"</literal>.  (Note that since the argument is a Nix
  string literal, you have to escape the quotes.)</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--argstr</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is like <option>--arg</option>, only the
  value is not a Nix expression but a string.  So instead of
  <literal>--arg system \"i686-linux\"</literal> (the outer quotes are
  to keep the shell happy) you can say <literal>--argstr system
  i686-linux</literal>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry xml:id="opt-attr"><term><option>--attr</option> / <option>-A</option>
<replaceable>attrPath</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>Select an attribute from the top-level Nix
  expression being evaluated.  (<command>nix-env</command>,
  <command>nix-instantiate</command>, <command>nix-build</command> and
  <command>nix-shell</command> only.)  The <emphasis>attribute
  path</emphasis> <replaceable>attrPath</replaceable> is a sequence of
  attribute names separated by dots.  For instance, given a top-level
  Nix expression <replaceable>e</replaceable>, the attribute path
  <literal>xorg.xorgserver</literal> would cause the expression
  <literal><replaceable>e</replaceable>.xorg.xorgserver</literal> to
  be used.  See <link linkend="refsec-nix-env-install-examples"><command>nix-env
  --install</command></link> for some concrete examples.</para>

  <para>In addition to attribute names, you can also specify array
  indices.  For instance, the attribute path
  <literal>foo.3.bar</literal> selects the <literal>bar</literal>
  attribute of the fourth element of the array in the
  <literal>foo</literal> attribute of the top-level
  expression.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--expr</option> / <option>-E</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Interpret the command line arguments as a list of
  Nix expressions to be parsed and evaluated, rather than as a list
  of file names of Nix expressions.
  (<command>nix-instantiate</command>, <command>nix-build</command>
  and <command>nix-shell</command> only.)</para>

  <para>For <command>nix-shell</command>, this option is commonly used
  to give you a shell in which you can build the packages returned
  by the expression. If you want to get a shell which contain the
  <emphasis>built</emphasis> packages ready for use, give your
  expression to the <command>nix-shell -p</command> convenience flag
  instead.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry xml:id="opt-I"><term><option>-I</option> <replaceable>path</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>Add a path to the Nix expression search path.  This
  option may be given multiple times.  See the <envar linkend="env-NIX_PATH">NIX_PATH</envar> environment variable for
  information on the semantics of the Nix search path.  Paths added
  through <option>-I</option> take precedence over
  <envar>NIX_PATH</envar>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--option</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>Set the Nix configuration option
  <replaceable>name</replaceable> to <replaceable>value</replaceable>.
  This overrides settings in the Nix configuration file (see
  <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nix.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>).</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><option>--repair</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Fix corrupted or missing store paths by
  redownloading or rebuilding them.  Note that this is slow because it
  requires computing a cryptographic hash of the contents of every
  path in the closure of the build.  Also note the warning under
  <command>nix-store --repair-path</command>.</para></listitem>

<title>Common Environment Variables</title>


<para>Most Nix commands interpret the following environment variables:</para>

<variablelist xml:id="env-common">

<varlistentry><term><envar>IN_NIX_SHELL</envar></term>

  <listitem><para>Indicator that tells if the current environment was set up by
  <command>nix-shell</command>.  Since Nix 2.0 the values are
  <literal>"pure"</literal> and <literal>"impure"</literal></para></listitem>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry xml:id="env-NIX_PATH"><term><envar>NIX_PATH</envar></term>

  <listitem>

    <para>A colon-separated list of directories used to look up Nix
    expressions enclosed in angle brackets (i.e.,
    <literal>&lt;<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal>).  For
    instance, the value

    <screen>
/home/eelco/Dev:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to look for paths relative to
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev</filename> and
    <filename>/etc/nixos</filename>, in this order.  It is also
    possible to match paths against a prefix.  For example, the value

    <screen>
nixpkgs=/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to search for
    <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal> in
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>
    and
    <filename>/etc/nixos/nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>.</para>

    <para>If a path in the Nix search path starts with
    <literal>http://</literal> or <literal>https://</literal>, it is
    interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and
    unpacked to a temporary location. The tarball must consist of a
    single top-level directory. For example, setting
    <envar>NIX_PATH</envar> to

    <screen>
nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-15.09.tar.gz</screen>

    tells Nix to download the latest revision in the Nixpkgs/NixOS
    15.09 channel.</para>

    <para>A following shorthand can be used to refer to the official channels:

    <screen>nixpkgs=channel:nixos-15.09</screen>
    </para>

    <para>The search path can be extended using the <option linkend="opt-I">-I</option> option, which takes precedence over
    <envar>NIX_PATH</envar>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>


<varlistentry><term><envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
  <filename>/nix/store</filename>) is not allowed to contain any
  symlink components.  This is to prevent &#x201C;impure&#x201D; builds.  Builders
  sometimes &#x201C;canonicalise&#x201D; paths by resolving all symlink components.
  Thus, builds on different machines (with
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolving to different locations)
  could yield different results.  This is generally not a problem,
  except when builds are deployed to machines where
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolves differently.  If you are
  sure that you&#x2019;re not going to do that, you can set
  <envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar> to <envar>1</envar>.</para>

  <para>Note that if you&#x2019;re symlinking the Nix store so that you can
  put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux
  you&#x2019;re better off using <literal>bind</literal> mount points, e.g.,

  <screen>
$ mkdir /nix
$ mount -o bind /mnt/otherdisk/nix /nix</screen>

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The command <command>nix-env</command> is used to manipulate Nix
user environments.  User environments are sets of software packages
available to a user at some point in time.  In other words, they are a
synthesised view of the programs available in the Nix store.  There
may be many user environments: different users can have different
environments, and individual users can switch between different
environments.</para>

<para><command>nix-env</command> takes exactly one
<emphasis>operation</emphasis> flag which indicates the subcommand to
be performed.  These are documented below.</para>

</refsection>



<!--######################################################################-->

<refsection><title>Selectors</title>

<para>Several commands, such as <command>nix-env -q</command> and
<command>nix-env -i</command>, take a list of arguments that specify
the packages on which to operate. These are extended regular
expressions that must match the entire name of the package. (For
details on regular expressions, see
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>regex</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>.)
The match is case-sensitive. The regular expression can optionally be
followed by a dash and a version number; if omitted, any version of
the package will match.  Here are some examples:

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>firefox</literal></term>
    <listitem><para>Matches the package name
    <literal>firefox</literal> and any version.</para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>firefox-32.0</literal></term>
    <listitem><para>Matches the package name
    <literal>firefox</literal> and version
    <literal>32.0</literal>.</para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>gtk\\+</literal></term>
    <listitem><para>Matches the package name
    <literal>gtk+</literal>. The <literal>+</literal> character must
    be escaped using a backslash to prevent it from being interpreted
    as a quantifier, and the backslash must be escaped in turn with
    another backslash to ensure that the shell passes it
    on.</para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>.\*</literal></term>
    <listitem><para>Matches any package name. This is the default for
    most commands.</para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>'.*zip.*'</literal></term>
    <listitem><para>Matches any package name containing the string
    <literal>zip</literal>. Note the dots: <literal>'*zip*'</literal>
    does not work, because in a regular expression, the character
    <literal>*</literal> is interpreted as a
    quantifier.</para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>'.*(firefox|chromium).*'</literal></term>
    <listitem><para>Matches any package name containing the strings
    <literal>firefox</literal> or
    <literal>chromium</literal>.</para></listitem>
  </varlistentry>

<refsection><title>Common options</title>

<para>This section lists the options that are common to all
operations.  These options are allowed for every subcommand, though
they may not always have an effect.  <phrase condition="manual">See
also <xref linkend="sec-common-options"/>.</phrase></para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry><term><option>--file</option> / <option>-f</option> <replaceable>path</replaceable></term>

    <listitem><para>Specifies the Nix expression (designated below as
    the <emphasis>active Nix expression</emphasis>) used by the
    <option>--install</option>, <option>--upgrade</option>, and
    <option>--query --available</option> operations to obtain
    derivations.  The default is
    <filename>~/.nix-defexpr</filename>.</para>

    <para>If the argument starts with <literal>http://</literal> or
    <literal>https://</literal>, it is interpreted as the URL of a
    tarball that will be downloaded and unpacked to a temporary
    location. The tarball must include a single top-level directory
    containing at least a file named <filename>default.nix</filename>.</para>

    </listitem>

  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term><option>--profile</option> / <option>-p</option> <replaceable>path</replaceable></term>

    <listitem><para>Specifies the profile to be used by those
    operations that operate on a profile (designated below as the
    <emphasis>active profile</emphasis>).  A profile is a sequence of
    user environments called <emphasis>generations</emphasis>, one of
    which is the <emphasis>current
    generation</emphasis>.</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term><option>--dry-run</option></term>

    <option>--switch-generation</option>,
    <option>--delete-generations</option> and
    <option>--rollback</option> operations, this flag will cause
    <command>nix-env</command> to print what
    <emphasis>would</emphasis> be done if this flag had not been
    specified, without actually doing it.</para>

    <para><option>--dry-run</option> also prints out which paths will
    be <link linkend="gloss-substitute">substituted</link> (i.e.,

  <listitem><para>By default, output written by builders to standard

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-max-jobs"><term><option>--max-jobs</option> / <option>-j</option>

  <listitem>

  <para>Sets the maximum number of build jobs that Nix will

  <literal>auto</literal> to use the number of CPUs in the system.
  The default is specified by the <link linkend="conf-max-jobs"><literal>max-jobs</literal></link>
  configuration setting, which itself defaults to
  <literal>1</literal>.  A higher value is useful on SMP systems or to
  exploit I/O latency.</para>

  <para> Setting it to <literal>0</literal> disallows building on the local
  machine, which is useful when you want builds to happen only on remote
  builders.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-cores"><term><option>--cores</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Sets the value of the <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar>
  environment variable in the invocation of builders.  Builders can
  use this variable at their discretion to control the maximum amount
  of parallelism.  For instance, in Nixpkgs, if the derivation
  attribute <varname>enableParallelBuilding</varname> is set to
  <literal>true</literal>, the builder passes the
  <option>-j<replaceable>N</replaceable></option> flag to GNU Make.
  It defaults to the value of the <link linkend="conf-cores"><literal>cores</literal></link>
  configuration setting, if set, or <literal>1</literal> otherwise.
  The value <literal>0</literal> means that the builder should use all
  available CPU cores in the system.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-max-silent-time"><term><option>--max-silent-time</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder
  can go without producing any data on standard output or standard
  error.  The default is specified by the <link linkend="conf-max-silent-time"><literal>max-silent-time</literal></link>
  configuration setting.  <literal>0</literal> means no
  time-out.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-timeout"><term><option>--timeout</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Sets the maximum number of seconds that a builder
  can run.  The default is specified by the <link linkend="conf-timeout"><literal>timeout</literal></link>
  configuration setting.  <literal>0</literal> means no
  timeout.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--keep-going</option> / <option>-k</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Keep going in case of failed builds, to the
  greatest extent possible.  That is, if building an input of some
  derivation fails, Nix will still build the other inputs, but not the
  derivation itself.  Without this option, Nix stops if any build
  fails (except for builds of substitutes), possibly killing builds in
  progress (in case of parallel or distributed builds).</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--keep-failed</option> / <option>-K</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Specifies that in case of a build failure, the
  temporary directory (usually in <filename>/tmp</filename>) in which
  the build takes place should not be deleted.  The path of the build
  directory is printed as an informational message.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--fallback</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which
  substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output
  paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the
  derivation.</para>

  <para>The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we
  have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution
  from, say, a network repository.  If the repository is down, the
  realisation of the derivation will fail.  When this option is
  specified, Nix will build the derivation instead.  Thus,
  installation from binaries falls back on installation from source.
  This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable
  for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a
  full build from source (with the related consumption of
  resources).</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--no-build-hook</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Disables the build hook mechanism.  This allows to ignore remote
  builders if they are setup on the machine.</para>

  <para>It's useful in cases where the bandwidth between the client and the
  remote builder is too low.  In that case it can take more time to upload the
  sources to the remote builder and fetch back the result than to do the
  computation locally.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--readonly-mode</option></term>

  <listitem><para>When this option is used, no attempt is made to open
  the Nix database.  Most Nix operations do need database access, so
  those operations will fail.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--arg</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is accepted by
  <command>nix-env</command>, <command>nix-instantiate</command>,
  <command>nix-shell</command> and <command>nix-build</command>.
  When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will
  automatically try to call functions that
  it encounters.  It can automatically call functions for which every
  argument has a <link linkend="ss-functions">default value</link>
  (e.g., <literal>{ <replaceable>argName</replaceable> ?
  <replaceable>defaultValue</replaceable> }:
  <replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>).  With
  <option>--arg</option>, you can also call functions that have
  arguments without a default value (or override a default value).
  That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument
  named <replaceable>name</replaceable>, it will call it with value
  <replaceable>value</replaceable>.</para>

  <para>For instance, the top-level <literal>default.nix</literal> in
  Nixpkgs is actually a function:

<programlisting>
{ # The system (e.g., `i686-linux') for which to build the packages.
  system ? builtins.currentSystem
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
}: <replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

  So if you call this Nix expression (e.g., when you do
  <literal>nix-env -i <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></literal>),
  the function will be called automatically using the value <link linkend="builtin-currentSystem"><literal>builtins.currentSystem</literal></link>
  for the <literal>system</literal> argument.  You can override this
  using <option>--arg</option>, e.g., <literal>nix-env -i
  <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable> --arg system
  \"i686-freebsd\"</literal>.  (Note that since the argument is a Nix
  string literal, you have to escape the quotes.)</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--argstr</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is like <option>--arg</option>, only the
  value is not a Nix expression but a string.  So instead of
  <literal>--arg system \"i686-linux\"</literal> (the outer quotes are
  to keep the shell happy) you can say <literal>--argstr system
  i686-linux</literal>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-attr"><term><option>--attr</option> / <option>-A</option>
<replaceable>attrPath</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>Select an attribute from the top-level Nix
  expression being evaluated.  (<command>nix-env</command>,
  <command>nix-instantiate</command>, <command>nix-build</command> and
  <command>nix-shell</command> only.)  The <emphasis>attribute
  path</emphasis> <replaceable>attrPath</replaceable> is a sequence of
  attribute names separated by dots.  For instance, given a top-level
  Nix expression <replaceable>e</replaceable>, the attribute path
  <literal>xorg.xorgserver</literal> would cause the expression
  <literal><replaceable>e</replaceable>.xorg.xorgserver</literal> to
  be used.  See <link linkend="refsec-nix-env-install-examples"><command>nix-env
  --install</command></link> for some concrete examples.</para>

  <para>In addition to attribute names, you can also specify array
  indices.  For instance, the attribute path
  <literal>foo.3.bar</literal> selects the <literal>bar</literal>
  attribute of the fourth element of the array in the
  <literal>foo</literal> attribute of the top-level
  expression.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--expr</option> / <option>-E</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Interpret the command line arguments as a list of
  Nix expressions to be parsed and evaluated, rather than as a list
  of file names of Nix expressions.
  (<command>nix-instantiate</command>, <command>nix-build</command>
  and <command>nix-shell</command> only.)</para>

  <para>For <command>nix-shell</command>, this option is commonly used
  to give you a shell in which you can build the packages returned
  by the expression. If you want to get a shell which contain the
  <emphasis>built</emphasis> packages ready for use, give your
  expression to the <command>nix-shell -p</command> convenience flag
  instead.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-I"><term><option>-I</option> <replaceable>path</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>Add a path to the Nix expression search path.  This
  option may be given multiple times.  See the <envar linkend="env-NIX_PATH">NIX_PATH</envar> environment variable for
  information on the semantics of the Nix search path.  Paths added
  through <option>-I</option> take precedence over
  <envar>NIX_PATH</envar>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--option</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The install operation creates a new user environment, based on
the current generation of the active profile, to which a set of store
paths described by <replaceable>args</replaceable> is added.  The
arguments <replaceable>args</replaceable> map to store paths in a
number of possible ways:

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>By default, <replaceable>args</replaceable> is a set
  of derivation names denoting derivations in the active Nix
  expression.  These are realised, and the resulting output paths are
  installed.  Currently installed derivations with a name equal to the
  name of a derivation being added are removed unless the option
  <option>--preserve-installed</option> is
  specified.</para>

  <para>If there are multiple derivations matching a name in
  <replaceable>args</replaceable> that have the same name (e.g.,
  <literal>gcc-3.3.6</literal> and <literal>gcc-4.1.1</literal>), then
  the derivation with the highest <emphasis>priority</emphasis> is
  used.  A derivation can define a priority by declaring the
  <varname>meta.priority</varname> attribute.  This attribute should
  be a number, with a higher value denoting a lower priority.  The
  default priority is <literal>0</literal>.</para>

  <para>If there are multiple matching derivations with the same
  priority, then the derivation with the highest version will be
  installed.</para>

  <para>You can force the installation of multiple derivations with
  the same name by being specific about the versions.  For instance,
  <literal>nix-env -i gcc-3.3.6 gcc-4.1.1</literal> will install both
  version of GCC (and will probably cause a user environment
  conflict!).</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>If <link linkend="opt-attr"><option>--attr</option></link>
  (<option>-A</option>) is specified, the arguments are
  <emphasis>attribute paths</emphasis> that select attributes from the
  top-level Nix expression.  This is faster than using derivation
  names and unambiguous.  To find out the attribute paths of available
  packages, use <literal>nix-env -qaP</literal>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>If <option>--from-profile</option>
  <replaceable>path</replaceable> is given,
  <replaceable>args</replaceable> is a set of names denoting installed
  store paths in the profile <replaceable>path</replaceable>.  This is
  an easy way to copy user environment elements from one profile to
  another.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>If <option>--from-expression</option> is given,
  <replaceable>args</replaceable> are Nix <link linkend="ss-functions">functions</link> that are called with the
  active Nix expression as their single argument.  The derivations
  returned by those function calls are installed.  This allows
  derivations to be specified in an unambiguous way, which is necessary
  if there are multiple derivations with the same
  name.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>If <replaceable>args</replaceable> are store
  derivations, then these are <link linkend="rsec-nix-store-realise">realised</link>, and the resulting
  output paths are installed.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>If <replaceable>args</replaceable> are store paths
  that are not store derivations, then these are <link linkend="rsec-nix-store-realise">realised</link> and
  installed.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>By default all outputs are installed for each derivation.
  That can be reduced by setting <literal>meta.outputsToInstall</literal>.
  </para></listitem> <!-- TODO: link nixpkgs docs on the ability to override those. -->

<refsection xml:id="ssec-version-comparisons"><title>Versions</title>

<para>The upgrade operation determines whether a derivation
<varname>y</varname> is an upgrade of a derivation
<varname>x</varname> by looking at their respective
<literal>name</literal> attributes.  The names (e.g.,
<literal>gcc-3.3.1</literal> are split into two parts: the package
name (<literal>gcc</literal>), and the version
(<literal>3.3.1</literal>).  The version part starts after the first
dash not followed by a letter.  <varname>x</varname> is considered an
upgrade of <varname>y</varname> if their package names match, and the
version of <varname>y</varname> is higher that that of
<varname>x</varname>.</para>

<para>The versions are compared by splitting them into contiguous
components of numbers and letters.  E.g., <literal>3.3.1pre5</literal>
is split into <literal>[3, 3, 1, "pre", 5]</literal>.  These lists are
then compared lexicographically (from left to right).  Corresponding
components <varname>a</varname> and <varname>b</varname> are compared
as follows.  If they are both numbers, integer comparison is used.  If
<varname>a</varname> is an empty string and <varname>b</varname> is a
number, <varname>a</varname> is considered less than
<varname>b</varname>.  The special string component
<literal>pre</literal> (for <emphasis>pre-release</emphasis>) is
considered to be less than other components.  String components are
considered less than number components.  Otherwise, they are compared
lexicographically (i.e., using case-sensitive string comparison).</para>

<para>This is illustrated by the following examples:

<screen>
1.0 &lt; 2.3
2.1 &lt; 2.3
2.3 = 2.3
2.5 &gt; 2.3

<para>The <option>--set-flag</option> operation allows meta attributes
of installed packages to be modified.  There are several attributes
that can be usefully modified, because they affect the behaviour of
<command>nix-env</command> or the user environment build
script:

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para><varname>priority</varname> can be changed to
  resolve filename clashes.  The user environment build script uses
  the <varname>meta.priority</varname> attribute of derivations to
  resolve filename collisions between packages.  Lower priority values
  denote a higher priority.  For instance, the GCC wrapper package and
  the Binutils package in Nixpkgs both have a file
  <filename>bin/ld</filename>, so previously if you tried to install
  both you would get a collision.  Now, on the other hand, the GCC
  wrapper declares a higher priority than Binutils, so the former&#x2019;s
  <filename>bin/ld</filename> is symlinked in the user
  environment.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><varname>keep</varname> can be set to
  <literal>true</literal> to prevent the package from being upgraded
  or replaced.  This is useful if you want to hang on to an older
  version of a package.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><varname>active</varname> can be set to
  <literal>false</literal> to &#x201C;disable&#x201D; the package.  That is, no
  symlinks will be generated to the files of the package, but it
  remains part of the profile (so it won&#x2019;t be garbage-collected).  It
  can be set back to <literal>true</literal> to re-enable the
  package.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

</refsection>

<refsection><title>Examples</title>

<para>To prevent the currently installed Firefox from being upgraded:

<screen>
$ nix-env --set-flag keep true firefox</screen>

After this, <command>nix-env -u</command> will ignore Firefox.</para>

<para>To disable the currently installed Firefox, then install a new
Firefox while the old remains part of the profile:

<para>The query operation displays information about either the store
paths that are installed in the current generation of the active

<para>This operation deletes the specified generations of the current
profile.  The generations can be a list of generation numbers, the
special value <literal>old</literal> to delete all non-current
generations,  a value such as <literal>30d</literal> to delete all
generations older than the specified number of days (except for the
generation that was active at that point in time), or a value such as
<literal>+5</literal> to keep the last <literal>5</literal> generations
ignoring any newer than current, e.g., if <literal>30</literal> is the current
generation <literal>+5</literal> will delete generation <literal>25</literal>
and all older generations.
Periodically deleting old generations is important to make garbage collection

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="env-NIX_PATH"><term><envar>NIX_PATH</envar></term>

  <listitem>

    <para>A colon-separated list of directories used to look up Nix
    expressions enclosed in angle brackets (i.e.,
    <literal>&lt;<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal>).  For
    instance, the value

    <screen>
/home/eelco/Dev:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to look for paths relative to
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev</filename> and
    <filename>/etc/nixos</filename>, in this order.  It is also
    possible to match paths against a prefix.  For example, the value

    <screen>
nixpkgs=/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to search for
    <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal> in
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>
    and
    <filename>/etc/nixos/nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>.</para>

    <para>If a path in the Nix search path starts with
    <literal>http://</literal> or <literal>https://</literal>, it is
    interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and
    unpacked to a temporary location. The tarball must consist of a
    single top-level directory. For example, setting
    <envar>NIX_PATH</envar> to

    <screen>
nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-15.09.tar.gz</screen>

    <para>A following shorthand can be used to refer to the official channels:

    <screen>nixpkgs=channel:nixos-15.09</screen>

    <para>The search path can be extended using the <option linkend="opt-I">-I</option> option, which takes precedence over

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
  <filename>/nix/store</filename>) is not allowed to contain any
  symlink components.  This is to prevent &#x201C;impure&#x201D; builds.  Builders
  sometimes &#x201C;canonicalise&#x201D; paths by resolving all symlink components.
  Thus, builds on different machines (with
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolving to different locations)
  could yield different results.  This is generally not a problem,
  except when builds are deployed to machines where
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolves differently.  If you are
  sure that you&#x2019;re not going to do that, you can set
  <envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar> to <envar>1</envar>.</para>

  <para>Note that if you&#x2019;re symlinking the Nix store so that you can
  put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux
  you&#x2019;re better off using <literal>bind</literal> mount points, e.g.,

  <screen>
$ mkdir /nix

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The <command>nix-build</command> command builds the derivations
described by the Nix expressions in <replaceable>paths</replaceable>.
If the build succeeds, it places a symlink to the result in the
current directory.  The symlink is called <filename>result</filename>.
If there are multiple Nix expressions, or the Nix expressions evaluate
to multiple derivations, multiple sequentially numbered symlinks are
created (<filename>result</filename>, <filename>result-2</filename>,
and so on).</para>

<para>If no <replaceable>paths</replaceable> are specified, then
<command>nix-build</command> will use <filename>default.nix</filename>
in the current directory, if it exists.</para>

<para>If an element of <replaceable>paths</replaceable> starts with
<literal>http://</literal> or <literal>https://</literal>, it is
interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and
unpacked to a temporary location. The tarball must include a single
top-level directory containing at least a file named
<filename>default.nix</filename>.</para>

<para><command>nix-build</command> is essentially a wrapper around
<link linkend="sec-nix-instantiate"><command>nix-instantiate</command></link>
(to translate a high-level Nix expression to a low-level store
derivation) and <link linkend="rsec-nix-store-realise"><command>nix-store
--realise</command></link> (to build the store derivation).</para>

<warning><para>The result of the build is automatically registered as
a root of the Nix garbage collector.  This root disappears
automatically when the <filename>result</filename> symlink is deleted
or renamed.  So don&#x2019;t rename the symlink.</para></warning>

  The default is specified by the <link linkend="conf-max-jobs"><literal>max-jobs</literal></link>
  configuration setting, which itself defaults to
  <literal>1</literal>.  A higher value is useful on SMP systems or to
  exploit I/O latency.</para>

  <para> Setting it to <literal>0</literal> disallows building on the local

  builders.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-cores"><term><option>--cores</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Sets the value of the <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar>
  environment variable in the invocation of builders.  Builders can
  use this variable at their discretion to control the maximum amount
  of parallelism.  For instance, in Nixpkgs, if the derivation
  attribute <varname>enableParallelBuilding</varname> is set to
  <literal>true</literal>, the builder passes the
  <option>-j<replaceable>N</replaceable></option> flag to GNU Make.
  It defaults to the value of the <link linkend="conf-cores"><literal>cores</literal></link>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--keep-failed</option> / <option>-K</option></term>

  <listitem><para>Specifies that in case of a build failure, the

    </para>
  </listitem>
</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--fallback</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which
  substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output
  paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the
  derivation.</para>

  <para>The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we
  have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution
  from, say, a network repository.  If the repository is down, the
  realisation of the derivation will fail.  When this option is
  specified, Nix will build the derivation instead.  Thus,
  installation from binaries falls back on installation from source.
  This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable
  for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a
  full build from source (with the related consumption of
  resources).</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--no-build-hook</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Disables the build hook mechanism.  This allows to ignore remote
  builders if they are setup on the machine.</para>

  <para>It's useful in cases where the bandwidth between the client and the
  remote builder is too low.  In that case it can take more time to upload the
  sources to the remote builder and fetch back the result than to do the
  computation locally.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--readonly-mode</option></term>

  <listitem><para>When this option is used, no attempt is made to open
  the Nix database.  Most Nix operations do need database access, so
  those operations will fail.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--arg</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is accepted by
  <command>nix-env</command>, <command>nix-instantiate</command>,
  <command>nix-shell</command> and <command>nix-build</command>.
  When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will
  automatically try to call functions that
  it encounters.  It can automatically call functions for which every
  argument has a <link linkend="ss-functions">default value</link>
  (e.g., <literal>{ <replaceable>argName</replaceable> ?
  <replaceable>defaultValue</replaceable> }:
  <replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>).  With
  <option>--arg</option>, you can also call functions that have
  arguments without a default value (or override a default value).
  That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument
  named <replaceable>name</replaceable>, it will call it with value
  <replaceable>value</replaceable>.</para>

  <para>For instance, the top-level <literal>default.nix</literal> in
  Nixpkgs is actually a function:

<programlisting>
{ # The system (e.g., `i686-linux') for which to build the packages.
  system ? builtins.currentSystem
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
}: <replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

  So if you call this Nix expression (e.g., when you do
  <literal>nix-env -i <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></literal>),
  the function will be called automatically using the value <link linkend="builtin-currentSystem"><literal>builtins.currentSystem</literal></link>
  for the <literal>system</literal> argument.  You can override this
  using <option>--arg</option>, e.g., <literal>nix-env -i
  <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable> --arg system
  \"i686-freebsd\"</literal>.  (Note that since the argument is a Nix
  string literal, you have to escape the quotes.)</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--argstr</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is like <option>--arg</option>, only the
  value is not a Nix expression but a string.  So instead of
  <literal>--arg system \"i686-linux\"</literal> (the outer quotes are
  to keep the shell happy) you can say <literal>--argstr system
  i686-linux</literal>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-attr"><term><option>--attr</option> / <option>-A</option>
<replaceable>attrPath</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>Select an attribute from the top-level Nix
  expression being evaluated.  (<command>nix-env</command>,
  <command>nix-instantiate</command>, <command>nix-build</command> and
  <command>nix-shell</command> only.)  The <emphasis>attribute
  path</emphasis> <replaceable>attrPath</replaceable> is a sequence of
  attribute names separated by dots.  For instance, given a top-level
  Nix expression <replaceable>e</replaceable>, the attribute path
  <literal>xorg.xorgserver</literal> would cause the expression
  <literal><replaceable>e</replaceable>.xorg.xorgserver</literal> to
  be used.  See <link linkend="refsec-nix-env-install-examples"><command>nix-env
  --install</command></link> for some concrete examples.</para>

  <para>In addition to attribute names, you can also specify array
  indices.  For instance, the attribute path
  <literal>foo.3.bar</literal> selects the <literal>bar</literal>
  attribute of the fourth element of the array in the
  <literal>foo</literal> attribute of the top-level
  expression.</para></listitem>

  <para>For <command>nix-shell</command>, this option is commonly used
  to give you a shell in which you can build the packages returned
  by the expression. If you want to get a shell which contain the
  <emphasis>built</emphasis> packages ready for use, give your

<para>If a derivation has multiple outputs,
<command>nix-build</command> will build the default (first) output.
You can also build all outputs:
<screen>
$ nix-build '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' -A openssl.all
</screen>
This will create a symlink for each output named
<filename>result-<replaceable>outputname</replaceable></filename>.
The suffix is omitted if the output name is <literal>out</literal>.
So if <literal>openssl</literal> has outputs <literal>out</literal>,
<literal>bin</literal> and <literal>man</literal>,
<command>nix-build</command> will create symlinks
<literal>result</literal>, <literal>result-bin</literal> and
<literal>result-man</literal>.  It&#x2019;s also possible to build a specific
output:
<screen>
$ nix-build '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' -A openssl.man
</screen>
This will create a symlink <literal>result-man</literal>.</para>

<para>Build a Nix expression given on the command line:

    possible to match paths against a prefix.  For example, the value

  <listitem>

  <para>Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
  <filename>/nix/store</filename>) is not allowed to contain any
  symlink components.  This is to prevent &#x201C;impure&#x201D; builds.  Builders
  sometimes &#x201C;canonicalise&#x201D; paths by resolving all symlink components.
  Thus, builds on different machines (with
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolving to different locations)
  could yield different results.  This is generally not a problem,
  except when builds are deployed to machines where
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolves differently.  If you are
  sure that you&#x2019;re not going to do that, you can set
  <envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar> to <envar>1</envar>.</para>

  <para>Note that if you&#x2019;re symlinking the Nix store so that you can
  put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux
  you&#x2019;re better off using <literal>bind</literal> mount points, e.g.,

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The command <command>nix-shell</command> will build the
dependencies of the specified derivation, but not the derivation
itself.  It will then start an interactive shell in which all
environment variables defined by the derivation
<replaceable>path</replaceable> have been set to their corresponding
values, and the script <literal>$stdenv/setup</literal> has been
sourced.  This is useful for reproducing the environment of a
derivation for development.</para>

<para>If <replaceable>path</replaceable> is not given,
<command>nix-shell</command> defaults to
<filename>shell.nix</filename> if it exists, and
<filename>default.nix</filename> otherwise.</para>

<para>If <replaceable>path</replaceable> starts with
<literal>http://</literal> or <literal>https://</literal>, it is
interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and
unpacked to a temporary location. The tarball must include a single
top-level directory containing at least a file named
<filename>default.nix</filename>.</para>

<para>If the derivation defines the variable
<varname>shellHook</varname>, it will be evaluated after
<literal>$stdenv/setup</literal> has been sourced.  Since this hook is
not executed by regular Nix builds, it allows you to perform
initialisation specific to <command>nix-shell</command>.  For example,
the derivation attribute

<programlisting>
shellHook =
  ''
    echo "Hello shell"
  '';
</programlisting>

will cause <command>nix-shell</command> to print <literal>Hello shell</literal>.</para>

    <listitem><para>In the environment of the derivation, run the
    shell command <replaceable>cmd</replaceable>. This command is
    executed in an interactive shell. (Use <option>--run</option> to
    use a non-interactive shell instead.) However, a call to
    <literal>exit</literal> is implicitly added to the command, so the
    shell will exit after running the command. To prevent this, add
    <literal>return</literal> at the end; e.g. <literal>--command
    "echo Hello; return"</literal> will print <literal>Hello</literal>
    and then drop you into the interactive shell. This can be useful
    for doing any additional initialisation.</para></listitem>

    <envar>HOME</envar>, <envar>USER</envar> and
    <envar>DISPLAY</envar>, are retained.  Note that

  </listitem>
</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--fallback</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which
  substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output
  paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the
  derivation.</para>

  <para>The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we
  have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution
  from, say, a network repository.  If the repository is down, the
  realisation of the derivation will fail.  When this option is
  specified, Nix will build the derivation instead.  Thus,
  installation from binaries falls back on installation from source.
  This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable
  for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a
  full build from source (with the related consumption of
  resources).</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--no-build-hook</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Disables the build hook mechanism.  This allows to ignore remote
  builders if they are setup on the machine.</para>

  <para>It's useful in cases where the bandwidth between the client and the
  remote builder is too low.  In that case it can take more time to upload the
  sources to the remote builder and fetch back the result than to do the
  computation locally.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--readonly-mode</option></term>

  <listitem><para>When this option is used, no attempt is made to open

  those operations will fail.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--arg</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is accepted by
  <command>nix-env</command>, <command>nix-instantiate</command>,
  <command>nix-shell</command> and <command>nix-build</command>.
  When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will
  automatically try to call functions that
  it encounters.  It can automatically call functions for which every
  argument has a <link linkend="ss-functions">default value</link>
  (e.g., <literal>{ <replaceable>argName</replaceable> ?
  <replaceable>defaultValue</replaceable> }:
  <replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>).  With
  <option>--arg</option>, you can also call functions that have
  arguments without a default value (or override a default value).
  That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument
  named <replaceable>name</replaceable>, it will call it with value
  <replaceable>value</replaceable>.</para>

  <para>For instance, the top-level <literal>default.nix</literal> in
  Nixpkgs is actually a function:

<programlisting>
{ # The system (e.g., `i686-linux') for which to build the packages.
  system ? builtins.currentSystem
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
}: <replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

  So if you call this Nix expression (e.g., when you do
  <literal>nix-env -i <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></literal>),
  the function will be called automatically using the value <link linkend="builtin-currentSystem"><literal>builtins.currentSystem</literal></link>
  for the <literal>system</literal> argument.  You can override this
  using <option>--arg</option>, e.g., <literal>nix-env -i
  <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable> --arg system
  \"i686-freebsd\"</literal>.  (Note that since the argument is a Nix
  string literal, you have to escape the quotes.)</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--argstr</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is like <option>--arg</option>, only the
  value is not a Nix expression but a string.  So instead of
  <literal>--arg system \"i686-linux\"</literal> (the outer quotes are
  to keep the shell happy) you can say <literal>--argstr system
  i686-linux</literal>.</para></listitem>

  path</emphasis> <replaceable>attrPath</replaceable> is a sequence of
  attribute names separated by dots.  For instance, given a top-level

  <para>In addition to attribute names, you can also specify array
  indices.  For instance, the attribute path

<para>To build the dependencies of the package Pan, and start an
interactive shell in which to build it:

<screen>
$ nix-shell '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' -A pan
[nix-shell]$ unpackPhase
[nix-shell]$ cd pan-*
[nix-shell]$ configurePhase
[nix-shell]$ buildPhase
[nix-shell]$ ./pan/gui/pan
</screen>

To clear the environment first, and do some additional automatic
initialisation of the interactive shell:

<screen>
$ nix-shell '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' -A pan --pure \
    --command 'export NIX_DEBUG=1; export NIX_CORES=8; return'
</screen>

Nix expressions can also be given on the command line using the
<command>-E</command> and <command>-p</command> flags.
For instance, the following starts a shell containing the packages
<literal>sqlite</literal> and <literal>libX11</literal>:

<screen>
$ nix-shell -E 'with import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; { }; runCommand "dummy" { buildInputs = [ sqlite xorg.libX11 ]; } ""'
</screen>

A shorter way to do the same is:

<screen>
$ nix-shell -p sqlite xorg.libX11
[nix-shell]$ echo $NIX_LDFLAGS
&#x2026; -L/nix/store/j1zg5v&#x2026;-sqlite-3.8.0.2/lib -L/nix/store/0gmcz9&#x2026;-libX11-1.6.1/lib &#x2026;
</screen>

Note that <command>-p</command> accepts multiple full nix expressions that
are valid in the <literal>buildInputs = [ ... ]</literal> shown above,
not only package names. So the following is also legal:

<screen>
$ nix-shell -p sqlite 'git.override { withManual = false; }'
</screen>

The <command>-p</command> flag looks up Nixpkgs in the Nix search
path. You can override it by passing <option>-I</option> or setting
<envar>NIX_PATH</envar>. For example, the following gives you a shell
containing the Pan package from a specific revision of Nixpkgs:

<screen>
$ nix-shell -p pan -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/8a3eea054838b55aca962c3fbde9c83c102b8bf2.tar.gz

[nix-shell:~]$ pan --version
Pan 0.139
</screen>

<refsection xml:id="ssec-nix-shell-shebang"><title>Use as a <literal>#!</literal>-interpreter</title>

<para>You can use <command>nix-shell</command> as a script interpreter
to allow scripts written in arbitrary languages to obtain their own
dependencies via Nix. This is done by starting the script with the
following lines:

<programlisting>
#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i <replaceable>real-interpreter</replaceable> -p <replaceable>packages</replaceable>
</programlisting>

where <replaceable>real-interpreter</replaceable> is the &#x201C;real&#x201D; script
interpreter that will be invoked by <command>nix-shell</command> after
it has obtained the dependencies and initialised the environment, and
<replaceable>packages</replaceable> are the attribute names of the
dependencies in Nixpkgs.</para>

<para>The lines starting with <literal>#! nix-shell</literal> specify
<command>nix-shell</command> options (see above). Note that you cannot
write <literal>#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell -i ...</literal> because
many operating systems only allow one argument in
<literal>#!</literal> lines.</para>

<para>For example, here is a Python script that depends on Python and
the <literal>prettytable</literal> package:

<programlisting>
#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i python -p python pythonPackages.prettytable

import prettytable

# Print a simple table.
t = prettytable.PrettyTable(["N", "N^2"])
for n in range(1, 10): t.add_row([n, n * n])
print t
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>Similarly, the following is a Perl script that specifies that it
requires Perl and the <literal>HTML::TokeParser::Simple</literal> and
<literal>LWP</literal> packages:

<programlisting>
#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i perl -p perl perlPackages.HTMLTokeParserSimple perlPackages.LWP

use HTML::TokeParser::Simple;

# Fetch nixos.org and print all hrefs.
my $p = HTML::TokeParser::Simple-&gt;new(url =&gt; 'http://nixos.org/');

while (my $token = $p-&gt;get_tag("a")) {
    my $href = $token-&gt;get_attr("href");
    print "$href\n" if $href;
}
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>Sometimes you need to pass a simple Nix expression to customize
a package like Terraform:

<programlisting><![CDATA[
#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i bash -p "terraform.withPlugins (plugins: [ plugins.openstack ])"

terraform apply
]]></programlisting>

<note><para>You must use double quotes (<literal>"</literal>) when
passing a simple Nix expression in a nix-shell shebang.</para></note>
</para>

<para>Finally, using the merging of multiple nix-shell shebangs the
following Haskell script uses a specific branch of Nixpkgs/NixOS (the
18.03 stable branch):

<programlisting><![CDATA[
#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i runghc -p "haskellPackages.ghcWithPackages (ps: [ps.HTTP ps.tagsoup])"
#! nix-shell -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-18.03.tar.gz

import Network.HTTP
import Text.HTML.TagSoup

-- Fetch nixos.org and print all hrefs.
main = do
  resp <- Network.HTTP.simpleHTTP (getRequest "http://nixos.org/")
  body <- getResponseBody resp
  let tags = filter (isTagOpenName "a") $ parseTags body
  let tags' = map (fromAttrib "href") tags
  mapM_ putStrLn $ filter (/= "") tags'
]]></programlisting>

If you want to be even more precise, you can specify a specific
revision of Nixpkgs:

<programlisting>
#! nix-shell -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/0672315759b3e15e2121365f067c1c8c56bb4722.tar.gz
</programlisting>

</para>

<para>The examples above all used <option>-p</option> to get
dependencies from Nixpkgs. You can also use a Nix expression to build
your own dependencies. For example, the Python example could have been
written as:

<programlisting>
#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell deps.nix -i python
</programlisting>

where the file <filename>deps.nix</filename> in the same directory
as the <literal>#!</literal>-script contains:

<programlisting>
with import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {};

runCommand "dummy" { buildInputs = [ python pythonPackages.prettytable ]; } ""
</programlisting>

</para>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="env-NIX_PATH"><term><envar>NIX_PATH</envar></term>

  <listitem>

    <para>A colon-separated list of directories used to look up Nix
    expressions enclosed in angle brackets (i.e.,
    <literal>&lt;<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal>).  For
    instance, the value

    <screen>
/home/eelco/Dev:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to look for paths relative to
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev</filename> and
    <filename>/etc/nixos</filename>, in this order.  It is also
    possible to match paths against a prefix.  For example, the value

    <screen>
nixpkgs=/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to search for
    <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal> in
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>
    and
    <filename>/etc/nixos/nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>.</para>

    <para>If a path in the Nix search path starts with
    <literal>http://</literal> or <literal>https://</literal>, it is
    interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and
    unpacked to a temporary location. The tarball must consist of a
    single top-level directory. For example, setting
    <envar>NIX_PATH</envar> to

    <screen>
nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-15.09.tar.gz</screen>

    tells Nix to download the latest revision in the Nixpkgs/NixOS
    15.09 channel.</para>

    <para>A following shorthand can be used to refer to the official channels:

    <screen>nixpkgs=channel:nixos-15.09</screen>
    </para>

    <para>The search path can be extended using the <option linkend="opt-I">-I</option> option, which takes precedence over
    <envar>NIX_PATH</envar>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
  <filename>/nix/store</filename>) is not allowed to contain any
  symlink components.  This is to prevent &#x201C;impure&#x201D; builds.  Builders
  sometimes &#x201C;canonicalise&#x201D; paths by resolving all symlink components.
  Thus, builds on different machines (with
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolving to different locations)
  could yield different results.  This is generally not a problem,
  except when builds are deployed to machines where
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolves differently.  If you are
  sure that you&#x2019;re not going to do that, you can set
  <envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar> to <envar>1</envar>.</para>

  <para>Note that if you&#x2019;re symlinking the Nix store so that you can
  put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux
  you&#x2019;re better off using <literal>bind</literal> mount points, e.g.,

  <screen>
$ mkdir /nix
$ mount -o bind /mnt/otherdisk/nix /nix</screen>

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The command <command>nix-store</command> performs primitive
operations on the Nix store.  You generally do not need to run this
command manually.</para>

<para><command>nix-store</command> takes exactly one
<emphasis>operation</emphasis> flag which indicates the subcommand to
be performed.  These are documented below.</para>

</refsection>



<!--######################################################################-->

<refsection><title>Common options</title>

<para>This section lists the options that are common to all
operations.  These options are allowed for every subcommand, though
they may not always have an effect.  <phrase condition="manual">See
also <xref linkend="sec-common-options"/> for a list of common
options.</phrase></para>

<variablelist>

  <varlistentry xml:id="opt-add-root"><term><option>--add-root</option> <replaceable>path</replaceable></term>

    <listitem><para>Causes the result of a realisation
    (<option>--realise</option> and <option>--force-realise</option>)
    to be registered as a root of the garbage collector<phrase condition="manual"> (see <xref linkend="ssec-gc-roots"/>)</phrase>.  The root is stored in
    <replaceable>path</replaceable>, which must be inside a directory
    that is scanned for roots by the garbage collector (i.e.,
    typically in a subdirectory of
    <filename>/nix/var/nix/gcroots/</filename>)
    <emphasis>unless</emphasis> the <option>--indirect</option> flag
    is used.</para>

    <para>If there are multiple results, then multiple symlinks will
    be created by sequentially numbering symlinks beyond the first one
    (e.g., <filename>foo</filename>, <filename>foo-2</filename>,
    <filename>foo-3</filename>, and so on).</para></listitem>

  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry><term><option>--indirect</option></term>

    <listitem>

    <para>In conjunction with <option>--add-root</option>, this option
    allows roots to be stored <emphasis>outside</emphasis> of the GC
    roots directory.  This is useful for commands such as
    <command>nix-build</command> that place a symlink to the build
    result in the current directory; such a build result should not be
    garbage-collected unless the symlink is removed.</para>

    <para>The <option>--indirect</option> flag causes a uniquely named
    symlink to <replaceable>path</replaceable> to be stored in
    <filename>/nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto/</filename>.  For instance,

    <screen>
$ nix-store --add-root /home/eelco/bla/result --indirect -r <replaceable>...</replaceable>

$ ls -l /nix/var/nix/gcroots/auto
lrwxrwxrwx    1 ... 2005-03-13 21:10 dn54lcypm8f8... -&gt; /home/eelco/bla/result

$ ls -l /home/eelco/bla/result
lrwxrwxrwx    1 ... 2005-03-13 21:10 /home/eelco/bla/result -&gt; /nix/store/1r11343n6qd4...-f-spot-0.0.10</screen>

    Thus, when <filename>/home/eelco/bla/result</filename> is removed,
    the GC root in the <filename>auto</filename> directory becomes a
    dangling symlink and will be ignored by the collector.</para>

    <warning><para>Note that it is not possible to move or rename
    indirect GC roots, since the symlink in the
    <filename>auto</filename> directory will still point to the old
    location.</para></warning>

  <para>Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which

  derivation.</para>

  <para>The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we
  have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution
  from, say, a network repository.  If the repository is down, the
  realisation of the derivation will fail.  When this option is
  specified, Nix will build the derivation instead.  Thus,
  installation from binaries falls back on installation from source.
  This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable
  for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a
  full build from source (with the related consumption of
  resources).</para>

  <para>It's useful in cases where the bandwidth between the client and the

  sources to the remote builder and fetch back the result than to do the
  computation locally.</para>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--readonly-mode</option></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is accepted by

  When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will
  automatically try to call functions that
  it encounters.  It can automatically call functions for which every
  argument has a <link linkend="ss-functions">default value</link>
  (e.g., <literal>{ <replaceable>argName</replaceable> ?
  <replaceable>defaultValue</replaceable> }:
  <replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>).  With
  <option>--arg</option>, you can also call functions that have
  arguments without a default value (or override a default value).
  That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument
  named <replaceable>name</replaceable>, it will call it with value
  <replaceable>value</replaceable>.</para>

  <para>For instance, the top-level <literal>default.nix</literal> in
  Nixpkgs is actually a function:

<programlisting>
{ # The system (e.g., `i686-linux') for which to build the packages.
  system ? builtins.currentSystem
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
}: <replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

  So if you call this Nix expression (e.g., when you do
  <literal>nix-env -i <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></literal>),
  the function will be called automatically using the value <link linkend="builtin-currentSystem"><literal>builtins.currentSystem</literal></link>
  for the <literal>system</literal> argument.  You can override this
  using <option>--arg</option>, e.g., <literal>nix-env -i
  <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable> --arg system
  \"i686-freebsd\"</literal>.  (Note that since the argument is a Nix
  string literal, you have to escape the quotes.)</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>This option is like <option>--arg</option>, only the

  <literal>--arg system \"i686-linux\"</literal> (the outer quotes are

<para>The operation <option>--realise</option> essentially &#x201C;builds&#x201D;
the specified store paths.  Realisation is a somewhat overloaded term:

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>If the store path is a
  <emphasis>derivation</emphasis>, realisation ensures that the output
  paths of the derivation are <link linkend="gloss-validity">valid</link> (i.e., the output path and its

  ways.  First, it is possible that the outputs are already valid, in
  which case we are done immediately.  Otherwise, there may be <link linkend="gloss-substitute">substitutes</link> that produce the
  outputs (e.g., by downloading them).  Finally, the outputs can be
  produced by performing the build action described by the
  derivation.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>If the store path is not a derivation, realisation
  ensures that the specified path is valid (i.e., it and its closure
  exist in the file system).  If the path is already valid, we are
  done immediately.  Otherwise, the path and any missing paths in its
  closure may be produced through substitutes.  If there are no
  (successful) subsitutes, realisation fails.</para></listitem>

</refsection>

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The operation <option>--dump</option> produces a NAR (Nix
ARchive) file containing the contents of the file system tree rooted
at <replaceable>path</replaceable>.  The archive is written to
standard output.</para>

<para>A NAR archive is like a TAR or Zip archive, but it contains only
the information that Nix considers important.  For instance,
timestamps are elided because all files in the Nix store have their
timestamp set to 0 anyway.  Likewise, all permissions are left out
except for the execute bit, because all files in the Nix store have
444 or 555 permission.</para>

<para>Also, a NAR archive is <emphasis>canonical</emphasis>, meaning
that &#x201C;equal&#x201D; paths always produce the same NAR archive.  For instance,
directory entries are always sorted so that the actual on-disk order
doesn&#x2019;t influence the result.  This means that the cryptographic hash
of a NAR dump of a path is usable as a fingerprint of the contents of
the path.  Indeed, the hashes of store paths stored in Nix&#x2019;s database
(see <link linkend="refsec-nix-store-query"><literal>nix-store -q
--hash</literal></link>) are SHA-256 hashes of the NAR dump of each
store path.</para>

<para>NAR archives support filenames of unlimited length and 64-bit
file sizes.  They can contain regular files, directories, and symbolic
links, but not other types of files (such as device nodes).</para>

<para>The operation <option>--export</option> writes a serialisation

path).</para>

<para>This command does not produce a <emphasis>closure</emphasis> of
the specified paths, so if a store path references other store paths
that are missing in the target Nix store, the import will fail.  To

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The operation <option>--optimise</option> reduces Nix store disk

something like 25-35%.  Only regular files and symlinks are
hard-linked in this manner.  Files are considered identical when they
have the same NAR archive serialisation: that is, regular files must
have the same contents and permission (executable or non-executable),

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="env-NIX_PATH"><term><envar>NIX_PATH</envar></term>

  <listitem>

    <para>A colon-separated list of directories used to look up Nix
    expressions enclosed in angle brackets (i.e.,
    <literal>&lt;<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal>).  For
    instance, the value

    <screen>
/home/eelco/Dev:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to look for paths relative to
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev</filename> and
    <filename>/etc/nixos</filename>, in this order.  It is also
    possible to match paths against a prefix.  For example, the value

    <screen>
nixpkgs=/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to search for
    <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal> in
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>
    and
    <filename>/etc/nixos/nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>.</para>

    <para>If a path in the Nix search path starts with
    <literal>http://</literal> or <literal>https://</literal>, it is
    interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and
    unpacked to a temporary location. The tarball must consist of a
    single top-level directory. For example, setting
    <envar>NIX_PATH</envar> to

    <screen>
nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-15.09.tar.gz</screen>

    tells Nix to download the latest revision in the Nixpkgs/NixOS
    15.09 channel.</para>

    <para>A following shorthand can be used to refer to the official channels:

    <screen>nixpkgs=channel:nixos-15.09</screen>
    </para>

    <para>The search path can be extended using the <option linkend="opt-I">-I</option> option, which takes precedence over
    <envar>NIX_PATH</envar>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
  <filename>/nix/store</filename>) is not allowed to contain any
  symlink components.  This is to prevent &#x201C;impure&#x201D; builds.  Builders
  sometimes &#x201C;canonicalise&#x201D; paths by resolving all symlink components.
  Thus, builds on different machines (with
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolving to different locations)
  could yield different results.  This is generally not a problem,
  except when builds are deployed to machines where
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolves differently.  If you are
  sure that you&#x2019;re not going to do that, you can set
  <envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar> to <envar>1</envar>.</para>

  <para>Note that if you&#x2019;re symlinking the Nix store so that you can
  put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux
  you&#x2019;re better off using <literal>bind</literal> mount points, e.g.,

  <screen>
$ mkdir /nix
$ mount -o bind /mnt/otherdisk/nix /nix</screen>

<para>The command <command>nix-collect-garbage</command> is mostly an
alias of <link linkend="rsec-nix-store-gc"><command>nix-store
--gc</command></link>, that is, it deletes all unreachable paths in
the Nix store to clean up your system.  However, it provides two
additional options: <option>-d</option> (<option>--delete-old</option>),
which deletes all old generations of all profiles in
<filename>/nix/var/nix/profiles</filename> by invoking
<literal>nix-env --delete-generations old</literal> on all profiles
(of course, this makes rollbacks to previous configurations
impossible); and
<option>--delete-older-than</option> <replaceable>period</replaceable>,
where period is a value such as <literal>30d</literal>, which deletes
all generations older than the specified number of days in all profiles
in <filename>/nix/var/nix/profiles</filename> (except for the generations
that were active at that point in time).

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para><command>nix-copy-closure</command> gives you an easy and
efficient way to exchange software between machines.  Given one or
more Nix store <replaceable>paths</replaceable> on the local
machine, <command>nix-copy-closure</command> computes the closure of
those paths (i.e. all their dependencies in the Nix store), and copies
all paths in the closure to the remote machine via the
<command>ssh</command> (Secure Shell) command.  With the
<option>--from</option>, the direction is reversed:
the closure of <replaceable>paths</replaceable> on a remote machine is
copied to the Nix store on the local machine.</para>

<para>This command is efficient because it only sends the store paths
that are missing on the target machine.</para>

<para>Since <command>nix-copy-closure</command> calls
<command>ssh</command>, you may be asked to type in the appropriate
password or passphrase.  In fact, you may be asked
<emphasis>twice</emphasis> because <command>nix-copy-closure</command>
currently connects twice to the remote machine, first to get the set
of paths missing on the target machine, and second to send the dump of
those paths.  If this bothers you, use
<command>ssh-agent</command>.</para>

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The command <command>nix-hash</command> computes the
cryptographic hash of the contents of each
<replaceable>path</replaceable> and prints it on standard output.  By
default, it computes an MD5 hash, but other hash algorithms are
available as well.  The hash is printed in hexadecimal.  To generate
the same hash as <command>nix-prefetch-url</command> you have to
specify multiple arguments, see below for an example.</para>

<para>The hash is computed over a <emphasis>serialisation</emphasis>
of each path: a dump of the file system tree rooted at the path.  This
allows directories and symlinks to be hashed as well as regular files.
The dump is in the <emphasis>NAR format</emphasis> produced by <link linkend="refsec-nix-store-dump"><command>nix-store</command>
<option>--dump</option></link>.  Thus, <literal>nix-hash
<replaceable>path</replaceable></literal> yields the same
cryptographic hash as <literal>nix-store --dump
<replaceable>path</replaceable> | md5sum</literal>.</para>

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The command <command>nix-instantiate</command> generates <link linkend="gloss-derivation">store derivations</link> from (high-level)
Nix expressions.  It evaluates the Nix expressions in each of
<replaceable>files</replaceable> (which defaults to
<replaceable>./default.nix</replaceable>).  Each top-level expression
should evaluate to a derivation, a list of derivations, or a set of
derivations.  The paths of the resulting store derivations are printed
on standard output.</para>

<para>If <replaceable>files</replaceable> is the character
<literal>-</literal>, then a Nix expression will be read from standard
input.</para>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--fallback</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Whenever Nix attempts to build a derivation for which
  substitutes are known for each output path, but realising the output
  paths through the substitutes fails, fall back on building the
  derivation.</para>

  <para>The most common scenario in which this is useful is when we
  have registered substitutes in order to perform binary distribution
  from, say, a network repository.  If the repository is down, the
  realisation of the derivation will fail.  When this option is
  specified, Nix will build the derivation instead.  Thus,
  installation from binaries falls back on installation from source.
  This option is not the default since it is generally not desirable
  for a transient failure in obtaining the substitutes to lead to a
  full build from source (with the related consumption of
  resources).</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--no-build-hook</option></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Disables the build hook mechanism.  This allows to ignore remote
  builders if they are setup on the machine.</para>

  <para>It's useful in cases where the bandwidth between the client and the
  remote builder is too low.  In that case it can take more time to upload the
  sources to the remote builder and fetch back the result than to do the
  computation locally.</para>

  </listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--readonly-mode</option></term>

  <listitem><para>When this option is used, no attempt is made to open
  the Nix database.  Most Nix operations do need database access, so
  those operations will fail.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--arg</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is accepted by
  <command>nix-env</command>, <command>nix-instantiate</command>,
  <command>nix-shell</command> and <command>nix-build</command>.
  When evaluating Nix expressions, the expression evaluator will
  automatically try to call functions that
  it encounters.  It can automatically call functions for which every
  argument has a <link linkend="ss-functions">default value</link>
  (e.g., <literal>{ <replaceable>argName</replaceable> ?
  <replaceable>defaultValue</replaceable> }:
  <replaceable>...</replaceable></literal>).  With
  <option>--arg</option>, you can also call functions that have
  arguments without a default value (or override a default value).
  That is, if the evaluator encounters a function with an argument
  named <replaceable>name</replaceable>, it will call it with value
  <replaceable>value</replaceable>.</para>

  <para>For instance, the top-level <literal>default.nix</literal> in
  Nixpkgs is actually a function:

<programlisting>
{ # The system (e.g., `i686-linux') for which to build the packages.
  system ? builtins.currentSystem
  <replaceable>...</replaceable>
}: <replaceable>...</replaceable></programlisting>

  So if you call this Nix expression (e.g., when you do
  <literal>nix-env -i <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable></literal>),
  the function will be called automatically using the value <link linkend="builtin-currentSystem"><literal>builtins.currentSystem</literal></link>
  for the <literal>system</literal> argument.  You can override this
  using <option>--arg</option>, e.g., <literal>nix-env -i
  <replaceable>pkgname</replaceable> --arg system
  \"i686-freebsd\"</literal>.  (Note that since the argument is a Nix
  string literal, you have to escape the quotes.)</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><option>--argstr</option> <replaceable>name</replaceable> <replaceable>value</replaceable></term>

  <listitem><para>This option is like <option>--arg</option>, only the
  value is not a Nix expression but a string.  So instead of
  <literal>--arg system \"i686-linux\"</literal> (the outer quotes are

  i686-linux</literal>.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" xml:id="opt-attr"><term><option>--attr</option> / <option>-A</option>
<replaceable>attrPath</replaceable></term>

  path</emphasis> <replaceable>attrPath</replaceable> is a sequence of
  attribute names separated by dots.  For instance, given a top-level

  <listitem>

    <para>A colon-separated list of directories used to look up Nix
    expressions enclosed in angle brackets (i.e.,
    <literal>&lt;<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal>).  For
    instance, the value

    <screen>
/home/eelco/Dev:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to look for paths relative to
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev</filename> and
    <filename>/etc/nixos</filename>, in this order.  It is also
    possible to match paths against a prefix.  For example, the value

    <screen>
nixpkgs=/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch:/etc/nixos</screen>

    will cause Nix to search for
    <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/<replaceable>path</replaceable>&gt;</literal> in
    <filename>/home/eelco/Dev/nixpkgs-branch/<replaceable>path</replaceable></filename>
    and

    <para>If a path in the Nix search path starts with
    <literal>http://</literal> or <literal>https://</literal>, it is
    interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded and
    unpacked to a temporary location. The tarball must consist of a

nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/nixos-15.09.tar.gz</screen>

</varlistentry><varlistentry xmlns="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><term><envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar></term>

  <listitem>

  <para>Normally, the Nix store directory (typically
  <filename>/nix/store</filename>) is not allowed to contain any
  symlink components.  This is to prevent &#x201C;impure&#x201D; builds.  Builders
  sometimes &#x201C;canonicalise&#x201D; paths by resolving all symlink components.
  Thus, builds on different machines (with
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolving to different locations)
  could yield different results.  This is generally not a problem,
  except when builds are deployed to machines where
  <filename>/nix/store</filename> resolves differently.  If you are
  sure that you&#x2019;re not going to do that, you can set
  <envar>NIX_IGNORE_SYMLINK_STORE</envar> to <envar>1</envar>.</para>

  <para>Note that if you&#x2019;re symlinking the Nix store so that you can
  put it on another file system than the root file system, on Linux

<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>The command <command>nix-prefetch-url</command> downloads the
file referenced by the URL <replaceable>url</replaceable>, prints its
cryptographic hash, and copies it into the Nix store.  The file name
in the store is
<filename><replaceable>hash</replaceable>-<replaceable>baseName</replaceable></filename>,
where <replaceable>baseName</replaceable> is everything following the
final slash in <replaceable>url</replaceable>.</para>

<para>This command is just a convenience for Nix expression writers.
Often a Nix expression fetches some source distribution from the
network using the <literal>fetchurl</literal> expression contained in
Nixpkgs.  However, <literal>fetchurl</literal> requires a
cryptographic hash.  If you don't know the hash, you would have to
download the file first, and then <literal>fetchurl</literal> would
download it again when you build your Nix expression.  Since
<literal>fetchurl</literal> uses the same name for the downloaded file
as <command>nix-prefetch-url</command>, the redundant download can be
avoided.</para>

<para>If <replaceable>hash</replaceable> is specified, then a download
is not performed if the Nix store already contains a file with the
same hash and base name.  Otherwise, the file is downloaded, and an
error is signaled if the actual hash of the file does not match the
specified hash.</para>

<para>This command prints the hash on standard output.  Additionally,
if the option <option>--print-path</option> is used, the path of the
downloaded file in the Nix store is also printed.</para>

<para>By default Nix reads settings from the following places:</para>

<para>The system-wide configuration file
<filename><replaceable>sysconfdir</replaceable>/nix/nix.conf</filename>
(i.e. <filename>/etc/nix/nix.conf</filename> on most systems), or
<filename>$NIX_CONF_DIR/nix.conf</filename> if
<envar>NIX_CONF_DIR</envar> is set. Values loaded in this file are not forwarded to the Nix daemon. The
client assumes that the daemon has already loaded them.
</para>

<para>User-specific configuration files:</para>

<para>
  If <envar>NIX_USER_CONF_FILES</envar> is set, then each path separated by
  <literal>:</literal> will be loaded in reverse order.
</para>

<para>
  Otherwise it will look for <filename>nix/nix.conf</filename> files in
  <envar>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</envar> and <envar>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</envar>.

  The default location is <filename>$HOME/.config/nix.conf</filename> if
  those environment variables are unset.
</para>

<para>The configuration files consist of
<literal><replaceable>name</replaceable> =
<replaceable>value</replaceable></literal> pairs, one per line. Other
files can be included with a line like <literal>include
<replaceable>path</replaceable></literal>, where
<replaceable>path</replaceable> is interpreted relative to the current
conf file and a missing file is an error unless
<literal>!include</literal> is used instead.
Comments start with a <literal>#</literal> character.  Here is an
example configuration file:</para>

<programlisting>
keep-outputs = true       # Nice for developers
keep-derivations = true   # Idem
</programlisting>

<para>You can override settings on the command line using the
<option>--option</option> flag, e.g. <literal>--option keep-outputs
false</literal>.</para>

  <varlistentry xml:id="conf-build-users-group"><term><literal>build-users-group</literal></term>

    <listitem><para>This options specifies the Unix group containing

    builds should not be performed by the Nix account since that would
    allow users to arbitrarily modify the Nix store and database by
    supplying specially crafted builders; and they cannot be performed
    by the calling user since that would allow him/her to influence
    the build result.</para>

    <para>Therefore, if this option is non-empty and specifies a valid

    member of the group specified here (as listed in
    <filename>/etc/group</filename>).  Those user accounts should not
    be used for any other purpose!</para>

    <para>Nix will never run two builds under the same user account at
    the same time.  This is to prevent an obvious security hole: a
    malicious user writing a Nix expression that modifies the build
    result of a legitimate Nix expression being built by another user.
    Therefore it is good to have as many Nix build user accounts as
    you can spare.  (Remember: uids are cheap.)</para>

    <para>The build users should have permission to create files in
    the Nix store, but not delete them.  Therefore,
    <filename>/nix/store</filename> should be owned by the Nix
    account, its group should be the group specified here, and its
    mode should be <literal>1775</literal>.</para>

    <para>If the build users group is empty, builds will be performed
    under the uid of the Nix process (that is, the uid of the caller
    if <envar>NIX_REMOTE</envar> is empty, the uid under which the Nix
    daemon runs if <envar>NIX_REMOTE</envar> is

    <filename>/dev/pts</filename> (on Linux), and the paths configured with the
    <link linkend="conf-sandbox-paths"><literal>sandbox-paths</literal>
    option</link>. This is useful to prevent undeclared dependencies
    on files in directories such as <filename>/usr/bin</filename>. In
    addition, on Linux, builds run in private PID, mount, network, IPC
    and UTS namespaces to isolate them from other processes in the
    system (except that fixed-output derivations do not run in private
    network namespace to ensure they can access the network).</para>

    <para>Currently, sandboxing only work on Linux and macOS. The use
    of a sandbox requires that Nix is run as root (so you should use
    the <link linkend="conf-build-users-group">&#x201C;build users&#x201D;
    feature</link> to perform the actual builds under different users
    than root).</para>

    <para>If this option is set to <literal>relaxed</literal>, then
    fixed-output derivations and derivations that have the
    <varname>__noChroot</varname> attribute set to
    <literal>true</literal> do not run in sandboxes.</para>

    <para>The default is <literal>true</literal> on Linux and
    <literal>false</literal> on all other platforms.</para>

    platform you are building on (e.g., perform a Mac OS build on a
    Linux machine; the result would obviously be wrong).  It only

<title>Glossary</title>


<glosslist>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-derivation"><glossterm>derivation</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A description of a build action.  The result of a
  derivation is a store object.  Derivations are typically specified
  in Nix expressions using the <link linkend="ssec-derivation"><function>derivation</function>
  primitive</link>.  These are translated into low-level
  <emphasis>store derivations</emphasis> (implicitly by
  <command>nix-env</command> and <command>nix-build</command>, or
  explicitly by <command>nix-instantiate</command>).</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry><glossterm>store</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>The location in the file system where store objects
  live.  Typically <filename>/nix/store</filename>.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry><glossterm>store path</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>The location in the file system of a store object,
  i.e., an immediate child of the Nix store
  directory.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry><glossterm>store object</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A file that is an immediate child of the Nix store
  directory.  These can be regular files, but also entire directory
  trees.  Store objects can be sources (objects copied from outside of
  the store), derivation outputs (objects produced by running a build
  action), or derivations (files describing a build
  action).</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-substitute"><glossterm>substitute</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A substitute is a command invocation stored in the
  Nix database that describes how to build a store object, bypassing
  the normal build mechanism (i.e., derivations).  Typically, the
  substitute builds the store object by downloading a pre-built
  version of the store object from some server.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry><glossterm>purity</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>The assumption that equal Nix derivations when run
  always produce the same output.  This cannot be guaranteed in
  general (e.g., a builder can rely on external inputs such as the
  network or the system time) but the Nix model assumes
  it.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry><glossterm>Nix expression</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A high-level description of software packages and
  compositions thereof.  Deploying software using Nix entails writing
  Nix expressions for your packages.  Nix expressions are translated
  to derivations that are stored in the Nix store.  These derivations
  can then be built.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-reference"><glossterm>reference</glossterm>

  <glossdef>
    <para>A store path <varname>P</varname> is said to have a
    reference to a store path <varname>Q</varname> if the store object
    at <varname>P</varname> contains the path <varname>Q</varname>
    somewhere. The <emphasis>references</emphasis> of a store path are
    the set of store paths to which it has a reference.
    </para>
    <para>A derivation can reference other derivations and sources
    (but not output paths), whereas an output path only references other
    output paths.
    </para>
  </glossdef>

</glossentry>

<glossentry xml:id="gloss-reachable"><glossterm>reachable</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A store path <varname>Q</varname> is reachable from
  another store path <varname>P</varname> if <varname>Q</varname> is in the
  <link linkend="gloss-closure">closure</link> of the
  <link linkend="gloss-reference">references</link> relation.
  </para></glossdef>
</glossentry>

<glossentry xml:id="gloss-closure"><glossterm>closure</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>The closure of a store path is the set of store
  paths that are directly or indirectly &#x201C;reachable&#x201D; from that store
  path; that is, it&#x2019;s the closure of the path under the <link linkend="gloss-reference">references</link> relation. For a package, the
  closure of its derivation is equivalent to the build-time
  dependencies, while the closure of its output path is equivalent to its
  runtime dependencies. For correct deployment it is necessary to deploy whole
  closures, since otherwise at runtime files could be missing. The command
  <command>nix-store -qR</command> prints out closures of store paths.
  </para>
  <para>As an example, if the store object at path <varname>P</varname> contains
  a reference to path <varname>Q</varname>, then <varname>Q</varname> is
  in the closure of <varname>P</varname>. Further, if <varname>Q</varname>
  references <varname>R</varname> then <varname>R</varname> is also in
  the closure of <varname>P</varname>.
  </para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-output-path"><glossterm>output path</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A store path produced by a derivation.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-deriver"><glossterm>deriver</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>The deriver of an <link linkend="gloss-output-path">output path</link> is the store
  derivation that built it.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-validity"><glossterm>validity</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A store path is considered
  <emphasis>valid</emphasis> if it exists in the file system, is
  listed in the Nix database as being valid, and if all paths in its
  closure are also valid.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-user-env"><glossterm>user environment</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>An automatically generated store object that
  consists of a set of symlinks to &#x201C;active&#x201D; applications, i.e., other
  store paths.  These are generated automatically by <link linkend="sec-nix-env"><command>nix-env</command></link>.  See <xref linkend="sec-profiles"/>.</para>

  </glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-profile"><glossterm>profile</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A symlink to the current <link linkend="gloss-user-env">user environment</link> of a user, e.g.,
  <filename>/nix/var/nix/profiles/default</filename>.</para></glossdef>

</glossentry>


<glossentry xml:id="gloss-nar"><glossterm>NAR</glossterm>

  <glossdef><para>A <emphasis>N</emphasis>ix
  <emphasis>AR</emphasis>chive.  This is a serialisation of a path in
  the Nix store.  It can contain regular files, directories and
  symbolic links.  NARs are generated and unpacked using
  <command>nix-store --dump</command> and <command>nix-store
  --restore</command>.</para></glossdef>

<title>Hacking</title>

<para>This section provides some notes on how to hack on Nix. To get
the latest version of Nix from GitHub:
<screen>
$ git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nix.git
$ cd nix
</screen>
</para>

<para>To build Nix for the current operating system/architecture use

<screen>
$ nix-build
</screen>

or if you have a flakes-enabled nix:

<screen>
$ nix build
</screen>

This will build <literal>defaultPackage</literal> attribute defined in the <literal>flake.nix</literal> file.

To build for other platforms add one of the following suffixes to it: aarch64-linux,
i686-linux, x86_64-darwin, x86_64-linux.

i.e.

<screen>
nix-build -A defaultPackage.x86_64-linux
</screen>

</para>

<para>To build all dependencies and start a shell in which all
environment variables are set up so that those dependencies can be
found:
<screen>
$ nix-shell
</screen>
To build Nix itself in this shell:
<screen>
[nix-shell]$ ./bootstrap.sh
[nix-shell]$ ./configure $configureFlags
[nix-shell]$ make -j $NIX_BUILD_CORES
</screen>
To install it in <literal>$(pwd)/inst</literal> and test it:
<screen>
[nix-shell]$ make install
[nix-shell]$ make installcheck
[nix-shell]$ ./inst/bin/nix --version
nix (Nix) 2.4
</screen>

If you have a flakes-enabled nix you can replace:

<screen>
$ nix-shell
</screen>

by:

<screen>
$ nix develop
</screen>

<title>Release 2.3 (2019-09-04)</title>

<para>This is primarily a bug fix release. However, it makes some
incompatible changes:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now uses BSD file locks instead of POSIX file
    locks. Because of this, you should not use Nix 2.3 and previous
    releases at the same time on a Nix store.</para>
  </listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>It also has the following changes:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para><function>builtins.fetchGit</function>'s <varname>ref</varname>
    argument now allows specifying an absolute remote ref.
    Nix will automatically prefix <varname>ref</varname> with
    <literal>refs/heads</literal> only if <varname>ref</varname> doesn't
    already begin with <literal>refs/</literal>.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The installer now enables sandboxing by default on Linux when the
    system has the necessary kernel support.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The <literal>max-jobs</literal> setting now defaults to 1.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>New builtin functions:
    <literal>builtins.isPath</literal>,
    <literal>builtins.hashFile</literal>.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The <command>nix</command> command has a new
    <option>--print-build-logs</option> (<option>-L</option>) flag to
    print build log output to stderr, rather than showing the last log
    line in the progress bar. To distinguish between concurrent
    builds, log lines are prefixed by the name of the package.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Builds are now executed in a pseudo-terminal, and the
    <envar>TERM</envar> environment variable is set to
    <literal>xterm-256color</literal>. This allows many programs
    (e.g. <command>gcc</command>, <command>clang</command>,
    <command>cmake</command>) to print colorized log output.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Add <option>--no-net</option> convenience flag. This flag
    disables substituters; sets the <literal>tarball-ttl</literal>
    setting to infinity (ensuring that any previously downloaded files
    are considered current); and disables retrying downloads and sets
    the connection timeout to the minimum. This flag is enabled
    automatically if there are no configured non-loopback network
    interfaces.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Add a <literal>post-build-hook</literal> setting to run a
    program after a build has succeeded.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Add a <literal>trace-function-calls</literal> setting to log
    the duration of Nix function calls to stderr.</para>
  </listitem>

<title>Release 2.2 (2019-01-11)</title>

<para>This is primarily a bug fix release. It also has the following
changes:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>In derivations that use structured attributes (i.e. that
    specify set the <varname>__structuredAttrs</varname> attribute to
    <literal>true</literal> to cause all attributes to be passed to
    the builder in JSON format), you can now specify closure checks
    per output, e.g.:

<programlisting>
outputChecks."out" = {
  # The closure of 'out' must not be larger than 256 MiB.
  maxClosureSize = 256 * 1024 * 1024;

  # It must not refer to C compiler or to the 'dev' output.
  disallowedRequisites = [ stdenv.cc "dev" ];
};

outputChecks."dev" = {
  # The 'dev' output must not be larger than 128 KiB.
  maxSize = 128 * 1024;
};
</programlisting>

    </para>
  </listitem>


  <listitem>
    <para>The derivation attribute
    <varname>requiredSystemFeatures</varname> is now enforced for
    local builds, and not just to route builds to remote builders.
    The supported features of a machine can be specified through the
    configuration setting <varname>system-features</varname>.</para>

    <para>By default, <varname>system-features</varname> includes
    <literal>kvm</literal> if <filename>/dev/kvm</filename>
    exists. For compatibility, it also includes the pseudo-features
    <literal>nixos-test</literal>, <literal>benchmark</literal> and
    <literal>big-parallel</literal> which are used by Nixpkgs to route
    builds to particular Hydra build machines.</para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Sandbox builds are now enabled by default on Linux.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The new command <command>nix doctor</command> shows
    potential issues with your Nix installation.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The <literal>fetchGit</literal> builtin function now uses a
    caching scheme that puts different remote repositories in distinct
    local repositories, rather than a single shared repository. This
    may require more disk space but is faster.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The <literal>dirOf</literal> builtin function now works on
    relative paths.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now supports <link xlink:href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/">SRI hashes</link>,
    allowing the hash algorithm and hash to be specified in a single
    string. For example, you can write:

<programlisting>
import &lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt; {
  url = https://nixos.org/releases/nix/nix-2.1.3/nix-2.1.3.tar.xz;
  hash = "sha256-XSLa0FjVyADWWhFfkZ2iKTjFDda6mMXjoYMXLRSYQKQ=";
};
</programlisting>

    instead of

<programlisting>
import &lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt; {
  url = https://nixos.org/releases/nix/nix-2.1.3/nix-2.1.3.tar.xz;
  sha256 = "5d22dad058d5c800d65a115f919da22938c50dd6ba98c5e3a183172d149840a4";
};
</programlisting>

    </para>

    <para>In fixed-output derivations, the
    <varname>outputHashAlgo</varname> attribute is no longer mandatory
    if <varname>outputHash</varname> specifies the hash.</para>

    <para><command>nix hash-file</command> and <command>nix
    hash-path</command> now print hashes in SRI format by
    default. They also use SHA-256 by default instead of SHA-512
    because that's what we use most of the time in Nixpkgs.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Integers are now 64 bits on all platforms.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The evaluator now prints profiling statistics (enabled via
    the <envar>NIX_SHOW_STATS</envar> and
    <envar>NIX_COUNT_CALLS</envar> environment variables) in JSON
    format.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The option <option>--xml</option> in <command>nix-store
    --query</command> has been removed. Instead, there now is an
    option <option>--graphml</option> to output the dependency graph
    in GraphML format.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>All <filename>nix-*</filename> commands are now symlinks to
    <filename>nix</filename>. This saves a bit of disk space.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix repl</command> now uses
    <literal>libeditline</literal> or

<title>Release 2.0 (2018-02-22)</title>

<para>The following incompatible changes have been made:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>The manifest-based substituter mechanism
    (<command>download-using-manifests</command>) has been <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/867967265b80946dfe1db72d40324b4f9af988ed">removed</link>. It
    has been superseded by the binary cache substituter mechanism
    since several years. As a result, the following programs have been
    removed:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><command>nix-pull</command></para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><command>nix-generate-patches</command></para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><command>bsdiff</command></para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><command>bspatch</command></para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The &#x201C;copy from other stores&#x201D; substituter mechanism
    (<command>copy-from-other-stores</command> and the
    <envar>NIX_OTHER_STORES</envar> environment variable) has been
    removed. It was primarily used by the NixOS installer to copy
    available paths from the installation medium. The replacement is
    to use a chroot store as a substituter
    (e.g. <literal>--substituters /mnt</literal>), or to build into a
    chroot store (e.g. <literal>--store /mnt --substituters /</literal>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The command <command>nix-push</command> has been removed as
    part of the effort to eliminate Nix's dependency on Perl. You can
    use <command>nix copy</command> instead, e.g. <literal>nix copy
    --to file:///tmp/my-binary-cache <replaceable>paths&#x2026;</replaceable></literal></para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The &#x201C;nested&#x201D; log output feature (<option>--log-type
    pretty</option>) has been removed. As a result,
    <command>nix-log2xml</command> was also removed.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>OpenSSL-based signing has been <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/f435f8247553656774dd1b2c88e9de5d59cab203">removed</link>. This
    feature was never well-supported. A better alternative is provided
    by the <option>secret-key-files</option> and
    <option>trusted-public-keys</option> options.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Failed build caching has been <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/8cffec84859cec8b610a2a22ab0c4d462a9351ff">removed</link>. This
    feature was introduced to support the Hydra continuous build
    system, but Hydra no longer uses it.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><filename>nix-mode.el</filename> has been removed from
    Nix. It is now <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix-mode">a separate
    repository</link> and can be installed through the MELPA package
    repository.</para>
  </listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>This release has the following new features:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>It introduces a new command named <command>nix</command>,
    which is intended to eventually replace all
    <command>nix-*</command> commands with a more consistent and
    better designed user interface. It currently provides replacements
    for some (but not all) of the functionality provided by
    <command>nix-store</command>, <command>nix-build</command>,
    <command>nix-shell -p</command>, <command>nix-env -qa</command>,
    <command>nix-instantiate --eval</command>,
    <command>nix-push</command> and
    <command>nix-copy-closure</command>. It has the following major
    features:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>Unlike the legacy commands, it has a consistent way to
        refer to packages and package-like arguments (like store
        paths). For example, the following commands all copy the GNU
        Hello package to a remote machine:

        <screen>nix copy --to ssh://machine nixpkgs.hello</screen>
        <screen>nix copy --to ssh://machine /nix/store/0i2jd68mp5g6h2sa5k9c85rb80sn8hi9-hello-2.10</screen>
        <screen>nix copy --to ssh://machine '(with import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {}; hello)'</screen>

        By contrast, <command>nix-copy-closure</command> only accepted
        store paths as arguments.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It is self-documenting: <option>--help</option> shows
        all available command-line arguments. If
        <option>--help</option> is given after a subcommand, it shows
        examples for that subcommand. <command>nix
        --help-config</command> shows all configuration
        options.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It is much less verbose. By default, it displays a
        single-line progress indicator that shows how many packages
        are left to be built or downloaded, and (if there are running
        builds) the most recent line of builder output. If a build
        fails, it shows the last few lines of builder output. The full
        build log can be retrieved using <command>nix
        log</command>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/b8283773bd64d7da6859ed520ee19867742a03ba">provides</link>
        all <filename>nix.conf</filename> configuration options as
        command line flags. For example, instead of <literal>--option
        http-connections 100</literal> you can write
        <literal>--http-connections 100</literal>. Boolean options can
        be written as
        <literal>--<replaceable>foo</replaceable></literal> or
        <literal>--no-<replaceable>foo</replaceable></literal>
        (e.g. <option>--no-auto-optimise-store</option>).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Many subcommands have a <option>--json</option> flag to
        write results to stdout in JSON format.</para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <warning><para>Please note that the <command>nix</command> command
    is a work in progress and the interface is subject to
    change.</para></warning>

    <para>It provides the following high-level (&#x201C;porcelain&#x201D;)
    subcommands:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>nix build</command> is a replacement for
        <command>nix-build</command>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>nix run</command> executes a command in an
        environment in which the specified packages are available. It
        is (roughly) a replacement for <command>nix-shell
        -p</command>. Unlike that command, it does not execute the
        command in a shell, and has a flag (<command>-c</command>)
        that specifies the unquoted command line to be
        executed.</para>

        <para>It is particularly useful in conjunction with chroot
        stores, allowing Linux users who do not have permission to
        install Nix in <command>/nix/store</command> to still use
        binary substitutes that assume
        <command>/nix/store</command>. For example,

        <screen>nix run --store ~/my-nix nixpkgs.hello -c hello --greeting 'Hi everybody!'</screen>

        downloads (or if not substitutes are available, builds) the
        GNU Hello package into
        <filename>~/my-nix/nix/store</filename>, then runs
        <command>hello</command> in a mount namespace where
        <filename>~/my-nix/nix/store</filename> is mounted onto
        <command>/nix/store</command>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>nix search</command> replaces <command>nix-env
        -qa</command>. It searches the available packages for
        occurrences of a search string in the attribute name, package
        name or description. Unlike <command>nix-env -qa</command>, it
        has a cache to speed up subsequent searches.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>nix copy</command> copies paths between
        arbitrary Nix stores, generalising
        <command>nix-copy-closure</command> and
        <command>nix-push</command>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>nix repl</command> replaces the external
        program <command>nix-repl</command>. It provides an
        interactive environment for evaluating and building Nix
        expressions. Note that it uses <literal>linenoise-ng</literal>
        instead of GNU Readline.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>nix upgrade-nix</command> upgrades Nix to the
        latest stable version. This requires that Nix is installed in
        a profile. (Thus it won&#x2019;t work on NixOS, or if it&#x2019;s installed
        outside of the Nix store.)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><command>nix verify</command> checks whether store paths
        are unmodified and/or &#x201C;trusted&#x201D; (see below). It replaces
        <command>nix-store --verify</command> and <command>nix-store
        --verify-path</command>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The store abstraction that Nix has had for a long time to
    support store access via the Nix daemon has been extended
    significantly. In particular, substituters (which used to be
    external programs such as
    <command>download-from-binary-cache</command>) are now subclasses
    of the abstract <classname>Store</classname> class. This allows
    many Nix commands to operate on such store types. For example,
    <command>nix path-info</command> shows information about paths in
    your local Nix store, while <command>nix path-info --store
    https://cache.nixos.org/</command> shows information about paths
    in the specified binary cache. Similarly,
    <command>nix-copy-closure</command>, <command>nix-push</command>
    and substitution are all instances of the general notion of
    copying paths between different kinds of Nix stores.</para>

    <para>Stores are specified using an URI-like syntax,
    e.g. <uri>https://cache.nixos.org/</uri> or
    <uri>ssh://machine</uri>. The following store types are supported:

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>

        <para><classname>LocalStore</classname> (stori URI
        <literal>local</literal> or an absolute path) and the misnamed
        <classname>RemoteStore</classname> (<literal>daemon</literal>)
        provide access to a local Nix store, the latter via the Nix
        daemon. You can use <literal>auto</literal> or the empty
        string to auto-select a local or daemon store depending on
        whether you have write permission to the Nix store. It is no
        longer necessary to set the <envar>NIX_REMOTE</envar>
        environment variable to use the Nix daemon.</para>

        <para>As noted above, <classname>LocalStore</classname> now
        supports chroot builds, allowing the &#x201C;physical&#x201D; location of
        the Nix store
        (e.g. <filename>/home/alice/nix/store</filename>) to differ
        from its &#x201C;logical&#x201D; location (typically
        <filename>/nix/store</filename>). This allows non-root users
        to use Nix while still getting the benefits from prebuilt
        binaries from <uri>cache.nixos.org</uri>.</para>

      <listitem>

        <para><classname>BinaryCacheStore</classname> is the abstract

    <para>Security has been improved in various ways:

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>Nix now stores signatures for local store
        paths. When paths are copied between stores (e.g., copied from
        a binary cache to a local store), signatures are
        propagated.</para>

        <para>Locally-built paths are signed automatically using the
        secret keys specified by the <option>secret-key-files</option>
        store option. Secret/public key pairs can be generated using
        <command>nix-store
        --generate-binary-cache-key</command>.</para>

        <para>In addition, locally-built store paths are marked as
        &#x201C;ultimately trusted&#x201D;, but this bit is not propagated when
        paths are copied between stores.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Content-addressable store paths no longer require
        signatures &#x2014; they can be imported into a store by unprivileged
        users even if they lack signatures.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The command <command>nix verify</command> checks whether
        the specified paths are trusted, i.e., have a certain number
        of trusted signatures, are ultimately trusted, or are
        content-addressed.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Substitutions from binary caches <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/ecbc3fedd3d5bdc5a0e1a0a51b29062f2874ac8b">now</link>
        require signatures by default. This was already the case on
        NixOS.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In Linux sandbox builds, we <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/eba840c8a13b465ace90172ff76a0db2899ab11b">now</link>
        use <filename>/build</filename> instead of
        <filename>/tmp</filename> as the temporary build
        directory. This fixes potential security problems when a build
        accidentally stores its <envar>TMPDIR</envar> in some
        security-sensitive place, such as an RPATH.</para>
      </listitem>

    </para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><emphasis>Pure evaluation mode</emphasis>. With the
    <literal>--pure-eval</literal> flag, Nix enables a variant of the existing
    restricted evaluation mode that forbids access to anything that could cause
    different evaluations of the same command line arguments to produce a
    different result. This includes builtin functions such as
    <function>builtins.getEnv</function>, but more importantly,
    <emphasis>all</emphasis> filesystem or network access unless a content hash
    or commit hash is specified. For example, calls to
    <function>builtins.fetchGit</function> are only allowed if a
    <varname>rev</varname> attribute is specified.</para>

    <para>The goal of this feature is to enable true reproducibility
    and traceability of builds (including NixOS system configurations)
    at the evaluation level. For example, in the future,
    <command>nixos-rebuild</command> might build configurations from a
    Nix expression in a Git repository in pure mode. That expression
    might fetch other repositories such as Nixpkgs via
    <function>builtins.fetchGit</function>. The commit hash of the
    top-level repository then uniquely identifies a running system,
    and, in conjunction with that repository, allows it to be
    reproduced or modified.</para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>There are several new features to support binary
    reproducibility (i.e. to help ensure that multiple builds of the
    same derivation produce exactly the same output). When
    <option>enforce-determinism</option> is set to
    <literal>false</literal>, it&#x2019;s <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/8bdf83f936adae6f2c907a6d2541e80d4120f051">no
    longer</link> a fatal error if build rounds produce different
    output. Also, a hook named <option>diff-hook</option> is <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/9a313469a4bdea2d1e8df24d16289dc2a172a169">provided</link>
    to allow you to run tools such as <command>diffoscope</command>
    when build rounds produce different output.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Configuring remote builds is a lot easier now. Provided you
    are not using the Nix daemon, you can now just specify a remote
    build machine on the command line, e.g. <literal>--option builders
    'ssh://my-mac x86_64-darwin'</literal>. The environment variable
    <envar>NIX_BUILD_HOOK</envar> has been removed and is no longer
    needed. The environment variable <envar>NIX_REMOTE_SYSTEMS</envar>
    is still supported for compatibility, but it is also possible to
    specify builders in <command>nix.conf</command> by setting the
    option <literal>builders =
    @<replaceable>path</replaceable></literal>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>If a fixed-output derivation produces a result with an
    incorrect hash, the output path is moved to the location
    corresponding to the actual hash and registered as valid. Thus, a
    subsequent build of the fixed-output derivation with the correct
    hash is unnecessary.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-shell</command> <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/ea59f39326c8e9dc42dfed4bcbf597fbce58797c">now</link>
    sets the <varname>IN_NIX_SHELL</varname> environment variable
    during evaluation and in the shell itself. This can be used to
    perform different actions depending on whether you&#x2019;re in a Nix
    shell or in a regular build. Nixpkgs provides
    <varname>lib.inNixShell</varname> to check this variable during
    evaluation.</para>

    <uri>channel:<replaceable>channel-name</replaceable></uri> as a

    example, <literal>nix-build channel:nixos-15.09 -A hello</literal>
    will build the GNU Hello package from the
    <literal>nixos-15.09</literal> channel. In the future, this may
    use Git to fetch updates more efficiently.</para>

    allows Git repositories to be fetched at evaluation time. Thus it
    differs from the <function>fetchgit</function> function in
    Nixpkgs, which fetches at build time and cannot be used to fetch
    Nix expressions during evaluation. A typical use case is to import

<title>Release 1.11.10 (2017-06-12)</title>

<para>This release fixes a security bug in Nix&#x2019;s &#x201C;build user&#x201D; build
isolation mechanism. Previously, Nix builders had the ability to
create setuid binaries owned by a <literal>nixbld</literal>
user. Such a binary could then be used by an attacker to assume a
<literal>nixbld</literal> identity and interfere with subsequent
builds running under the same UID.</para>

<para>To prevent this issue, Nix now disallows builders to create
setuid and setgid binaries. On Linux, this is done using a seccomp BPF
filter. Note that this imposes a small performance penalty (e.g. 1%
when building GNU Hello). Using seccomp, we now also prevent the
creation of extended attributes and POSIX ACLs since these cannot be
represented in the NAR format and (in the case of POSIX ACLs) allow
bypassing regular Nix store permissions. On macOS, the restriction is
implemented using the existing sandbox mechanism, which now uses a
minimal &#x201C;allow all except the creation of setuid/setgid binaries&#x201D;
profile when regular sandboxing is disabled. On other platforms, the
&#x201C;build user&#x201D; mechanism is now disabled.</para>

<para>Thanks go to Linus Heckemann for discovering and reporting this
bug.</para>

<title>Release 1.11 (2016-01-19)</title>

<para>This is primarily a bug fix release. It also has a number of new
features:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-prefetch-url</command> can now download URLs
    specified in a Nix expression. For example,

<screen>
$ nix-prefetch-url -A hello.src
</screen>

    will prefetch the file specified by the
    <function>fetchurl</function> call in the attribute
    <literal>hello.src</literal> from the Nix expression in the
    current directory, and print the cryptographic hash of the
    resulting file on stdout. This differs from <literal>nix-build -A
    hello.src</literal> in that it doesn't verify the hash, and is
    thus useful when you&#x2019;re updating a Nix expression.</para>

    <para>You can also prefetch the result of functions that unpack a
    tarball, such as <function>fetchFromGitHub</function>. For example:

<screen>
$ nix-prefetch-url --unpack https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/archive/0.8.tar.gz
</screen>

    or from a Nix expression:

<screen>
$ nix-prefetch-url -A nix-repl.src
</screen>

    </para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The builtin function
    <function>&lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt;</function> now supports
    downloading and unpacking NARs. This removes the need to have
    multiple downloads in the Nixpkgs stdenv bootstrap process (like a
    separate busybox binary for Linux, or curl/mkdir/sh/bzip2 for
    Darwin). Now all those files can be combined into a single NAR,
    optionally compressed using <command>xz</command>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now supports SHA-512 hashes for verifying fixed-output
    derivations, and in <function>builtins.hashString</function>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      The new flag <option>--option build-repeat
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></option> will cause every build to
      be executed <replaceable>N</replaceable>+1 times. If the build
      output differs between any round, the build is rejected, and the
      output paths are not registered as valid. This is primarily
      useful to verify build determinism. (We already had a
      <option>--check</option> option to repeat a previously succeeded
      build. However, with <option>--check</option>, non-deterministic
      builds are registered in the DB. Preventing that is useful for
      Hydra to ensure that non-deterministic builds don't end up
      getting published to the binary cache.)
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      The options <option>--check</option> and <option>--option
      build-repeat <replaceable>N</replaceable></option>, if they
      detect a difference between two runs of the same derivation and
      <option>-K</option> is given, will make the output of the other
      run available under
      <filename><replaceable>store-path</replaceable>-check</filename>. This
      makes it easier to investigate the non-determinism using tools
      like <command>diffoscope</command>, e.g.,

<screen>
$ nix-build pkgs/stdenv/linux -A stage1.pkgs.zlib --check -K
error: derivation &#x2018;/nix/store/l54i8wlw2265&#x2026;-zlib-1.2.8.drv&#x2019; may not
be deterministic: output &#x2018;/nix/store/11a27shh6n2i&#x2026;-zlib-1.2.8&#x2019;
differs from &#x2018;/nix/store/11a27shh6n2i&#x2026;-zlib-1.2.8-check&#x2019;

$ diffoscope /nix/store/11a27shh6n2i&#x2026;-zlib-1.2.8 /nix/store/11a27shh6n2i&#x2026;-zlib-1.2.8-check

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix supports a new API for building derivations that doesn&#x2019;t
    require a <literal>.drv</literal> file to be present on disk; it

<title>Release 1.9 (2015-06-12)</title>

<para>In addition to the usual bug fixes, this release has the
following new features:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Signed binary cache support. You can enable signature
    checking by adding the following to <filename>nix.conf</filename>:

<programlisting>
signed-binary-caches = *
binary-cache-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
</programlisting>

    This will prevent Nix from downloading any binary from the cache
    that is not signed by one of the keys listed in
    <option>binary-cache-public-keys</option>.</para>

    <para>Signature checking is only supported if you built Nix with
    the <literal>libsodium</literal> package.</para>

    <para>Note that while Nix has had experimental support for signed
    binary caches since version 1.7, this release changes the
    signature format in a backwards-incompatible way.</para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para>Automatic downloading of Nix expression tarballs. In various
    places, you can now specify the URL of a tarball containing Nix
    expressions (such as Nixpkgs), which will be downloaded and
    unpacked automatically. For example:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>In <command>nix-env</command>:

<screen>
$ nix-env -f https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels/archive/nixos-14.12.tar.gz -iA firefox
</screen>

      This installs Firefox from the latest tested and built revision
      of the NixOS 14.12 channel.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>In <command>nix-build</command> and
      <command>nix-shell</command>:

<screen>
$ nix-build https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/master.tar.gz -A hello
</screen>

      This builds GNU Hello from the latest revision of the Nixpkgs
      master branch.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>In the Nix search path (as specified via
      <envar>NIX_PATH</envar> or <option>-I</option>). For example, to
      start a shell containing the Pan package from a specific version
      of Nixpkgs:

<screen>
$ nix-shell -p pan -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels/archive/8a3eea054838b55aca962c3fbde9c83c102b8bf2.tar.gz
</screen>

      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>In <command>nixos-rebuild</command> (on NixOS):

<screen>
$ nixos-rebuild test -I nixpkgs=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels/archive/nixos-unstable.tar.gz
</screen>

      </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>In Nix expressions, via the new builtin function <function>fetchTarball</function>:

<programlisting>
with import (fetchTarball https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs-channels/archive/nixos-14.12.tar.gz) {}; &#x2026;
</programlisting>

      (This is not allowed in restricted mode.)</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para><command>nix-shell</command> improvements:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><command>nix-shell</command> now has a flag
      <option>--run</option> to execute a command in the
      <command>nix-shell</command> environment,
      e.g. <literal>nix-shell --run make</literal>. This is like
      the existing <option>--command</option> flag, except that it
      uses a non-interactive shell (ensuring that hitting Ctrl-C won&#x2019;t
      drop you into the child shell).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><command>nix-shell</command> can now be used as
      a <literal>#!</literal>-interpreter. This allows you to write
      scripts that dynamically fetch their own dependencies. For
      example, here is a Haskell script that, when invoked, first
      downloads GHC and the Haskell packages on which it depends:

<programlisting>
#! /usr/bin/env nix-shell
#! nix-shell -i runghc -p haskellPackages.ghc haskellPackages.HTTP

import Network.HTTP

main = do
  resp &lt;- Network.HTTP.simpleHTTP (getRequest "http://nixos.org/")
  body &lt;- getResponseBody resp
  print (take 100 body)
</programlisting>

      Of course, the dependencies are cached in the Nix store, so the
      second invocation of this script will be much
      faster.</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para>Chroot improvements:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para>Chroot builds are now supported on Mac OS X
      (using its sandbox mechanism).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>If chroots are enabled, they are now used for
      all derivations, including fixed-output derivations (such as
      <function>fetchurl</function>). The latter do have network
      access, but can no longer access the host filesystem. If you
      need the old behaviour, you can set the option
      <option>build-use-chroot</option> to
      <literal>relaxed</literal>.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>On Linux, if chroots are enabled, builds are
      performed in a private PID namespace once again. (This
      functionality was lost in Nix 1.8.)</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Store paths listed in
      <option>build-chroot-dirs</option> are now automatically
      expanded to their closure. For instance, if you want
      <filename>/nix/store/&#x2026;-bash/bin/sh</filename> mounted in your
      chroot as <filename>/bin/sh</filename>, you only need to say
      <literal>build-chroot-dirs =
      /bin/sh=/nix/store/&#x2026;-bash/bin/sh</literal>; it is no longer
      necessary to specify the dependencies of Bash.</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>The new derivation attribute
  <varname>passAsFile</varname> allows you to specify that the
  contents of derivation attributes should be passed via files rather
  than environment variables. This is useful if you need to pass very
  long strings that exceed the size limit of the environment. The
  Nixpkgs function <function>writeTextFile</function> uses
  this.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>You can now use <literal>~</literal> in Nix file
  names to refer to your home directory, e.g. <literal>import
  ~/.nixpkgs/config.nix</literal>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Nix has a new option <option>restrict-eval</option>
  that allows limiting what paths the Nix evaluator has access to. By
  passing <literal>--option restrict-eval true</literal> to Nix, the
  evaluator will throw an exception if an attempt is made to access
  any file outside of the Nix search path. This is primarily intended
  for Hydra to ensure that a Hydra jobset only refers to its declared
  inputs (and is therefore reproducible).</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> now only creates a new
  &#x201C;generation&#x201D; symlink in <filename>/nix/var/nix/profiles</filename>
  if something actually changed.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The environment variable <envar>NIX_PAGER</envar>
  can now be set to override <envar>PAGER</envar>. You can set it to
  <literal>cat</literal> to disable paging for Nix commands
  only.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Failing <literal>&lt;...&gt;</literal>
  lookups now show position information.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Improved Boehm GC use: we disabled scanning for
  interior pointers, which should reduce the &#x201C;<literal>Repeated
  allocation of very large block</literal>&#x201D; warnings and associated
  retention of memory.</para></listitem>

<title>Release 1.8 (2014-12-14)</title>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>Breaking change: to address a race condition, the
  remote build hook mechanism now uses <command>nix-store
  --serve</command> on the remote machine. This requires build slaves
  to be updated to Nix 1.8.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Nix now uses HTTPS instead of HTTP to access the
  default binary cache,
  <literal>cache.nixos.org</literal>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> selectors are now regular
  expressions. For instance, you can do

<screen>
$ nix-env -qa '.*zip.*'
</screen>

  to query all packages with a name containing
  <literal>zip</literal>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-store --read-log</command> can now
  fetch remote build logs. If a build log is not available locally,
  then &#x2018;nix-store -l&#x2019; will now try to download it from the servers
  listed in the &#x2018;log-servers&#x2019; option in nix.conf. For instance, if you
  have the configuration option

<programlisting>
log-servers = http://hydra.nixos.org/log
</programlisting>

then it will try to get logs from
<literal>http://hydra.nixos.org/log/<replaceable>base name of the
store path</replaceable></literal>. This allows you to do things like:

<screen>
$ nix-store -l $(which xterm)
</screen>

  and get a log even if <command>xterm</command> wasn't built
  locally.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>New builtin functions:
  <function>attrValues</function>, <function>deepSeq</function>,
  <function>fromJSON</function>, <function>readDir</function>,
  <function>seq</function>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-instantiate --eval</command> now has a
  <option>--json</option> flag to print the resulting value in JSON
  format.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-copy-closure</command> now uses
  <command>nix-store --serve</command> on the remote side to send or
  receive closures. This fixes a race condition between
  <command>nix-copy-closure</command> and the garbage
  collector.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Derivations can specify the new special attribute
  <varname>allowedRequisites</varname>, which has a similar meaning to
  <varname>allowedReferences</varname>. But instead of only enforcing
  to explicitly specify the immediate references, it requires the
  derivation to specify all the dependencies recursively (hence the
  name, requisites) that are used by the resulting
  output.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>On Mac OS X, Nix now handles case collisions when
  importing closures from case-sensitive file systems. This is mostly
  useful for running NixOps on Mac OS X.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The Nix daemon has new configuration options
  <option>allowed-users</option> (specifying the users and groups that
  are allowed to connect to the daemon) and
  <option>trusted-users</option> (specifying the users and groups that
  can perform privileged operations like specifying untrusted binary
  caches).</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The configuration option
  <option>build-cores</option> now defaults to the number of available
  CPU cores.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Build users are now used by default when Nix is
  invoked as root. This prevents builds from accidentally running as
  root.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Nix now includes systemd units and Upstart
  jobs.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Speed improvements to <command>nix-store
  --optimise</command>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Language change: the <literal>==</literal> operator
  now ignores string contexts (the &#x201C;dependencies&#x201D; of a
  string).</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Nix now filters out Nix-specific ANSI escape
  sequences on standard error. They are supposed to be invisible, but
  some terminals show them anyway.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Various commands now automatically pipe their output
  into the pager as specified by the <envar>PAGER</envar> environment
  variable.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Several improvements to reduce memory consumption in
  the evaluator.</para></listitem>

<title>Release 1.7 (2014-04-11)</title>

<para>In addition to the usual bug fixes, this release has the
following new features:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Antiquotation is now allowed inside of quoted attribute
    names (e.g. <literal>set."${foo}"</literal>). In the case where
    the attribute name is just a single antiquotation, the quotes can
    be dropped (e.g. the above example can be written
    <literal>set.${foo}</literal>). If an attribute name inside of a
    set declaration evaluates to <literal>null</literal> (e.g.
    <literal>{ ${null} = false; }</literal>), then that attribute is
    not added to the set.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Experimental support for cryptographically signed binary
    caches.  See <link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/0fdf4da0e979f992db75cc17376e455ddc5a96d8">the
    commit for details</link>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>An experimental new substituter,
    <command>download-via-ssh</command>, that fetches binaries from
    remote machines via SSH.  Specifying the flags <literal>--option
    use-ssh-substituter true --option ssh-substituter-hosts
    <replaceable>user@hostname</replaceable></literal> will cause Nix
    to download binaries from the specified machine, if it has
    them.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-store -r</command> and
    <command>nix-build</command> have a new flag,
    <option>--check</option>, that builds a previously built
    derivation again, and prints an error message if the output is not
    exactly the same. This helps to verify whether a derivation is
    truly deterministic.  For example:

<screen>
$ nix-build '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' -A patchelf
<replaceable>&#x2026;</replaceable>
$ nix-build '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' -A patchelf --check
<replaceable>&#x2026;</replaceable>
error: derivation `/nix/store/1ipvxs&#x2026;-patchelf-0.6' may not be deterministic:
  hash mismatch in output `/nix/store/4pc1dm&#x2026;-patchelf-0.6.drv'
</screen>

    </para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The <command>nix-instantiate</command> flags
    <option>--eval-only</option> and <option>--parse-only</option>
    have been renamed to <option>--eval</option> and
    <option>--parse</option>, respectively.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-instantiate</command>,
    <command>nix-build</command> and <command>nix-shell</command> now
    have a flag <option>--expr</option> (or <option>-E</option>) that
    allows you to specify the expression to be evaluated as a command
    line argument.  For instance, <literal>nix-instantiate --eval -E
    '1 + 2'</literal> will print <literal>3</literal>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-shell</command> improvements:</para>

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem>
        <para>It has a new flag, <option>--packages</option> (or
        <option>-p</option>), that sets up a build environment
        containing the specified packages from Nixpkgs. For example,
        the command

<screen>
$ nix-shell -p sqlite xorg.libX11 hello
</screen>

        will start a shell in which the given packages are
        present.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It now uses <filename>shell.nix</filename> as the
        default expression, falling back to
        <filename>default.nix</filename> if the former doesn&#x2019;t
        exist.  This makes it convenient to have a
        <filename>shell.nix</filename> in your project to set up a
        nice development environment.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It evaluates the derivation attribute
        <varname>shellHook</varname>, if set. Since
        <literal>stdenv</literal> does not normally execute this hook,
        it allows you to do <command>nix-shell</command>-specific
        setup.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>It preserves the user&#x2019;s timezone setting.</para>
      </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>In chroots, Nix now sets up a <filename>/dev</filename>
    containing only a minimal set of devices (such as
    <filename>/dev/null</filename>). Note that it only does this if
    you <emphasis>don&#x2019;t</emphasis> have <filename>/dev</filename>
    listed in your <option>build-chroot-dirs</option> setting;
    otherwise, it will bind-mount the <literal>/dev</literal> from
    outside the chroot.</para>

    <para>Similarly, if you don&#x2019;t have <filename>/dev/pts</filename> listed
    in <option>build-chroot-dirs</option>, Nix will mount a private
    <literal>devpts</literal> filesystem on the chroot&#x2019;s
    <filename>/dev/pts</filename>.</para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>New built-in function: <function>builtins.toJSON</function>,
    which returns a JSON representation of a value.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-env -q</command> has a new flag
    <option>--json</option> to print a JSON representation of the
    installed or available packages.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-env</command> now supports meta attributes with
    more complex values, such as attribute sets.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The <option>-A</option> flag now allows attribute names with
    dots in them, e.g.

<screen>
$ nix-instantiate --eval '&lt;nixos&gt;' -A 'config.systemd.units."nscd.service".text'
</screen>

    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The <option>--max-freed</option> option to
    <command>nix-store --gc</command> now accepts a unit
    specifier. For example, <literal>nix-store --gc --max-freed
    1G</literal> will free up to 1 gigabyte of disk space.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-collect-garbage</command> has a new flag
    <option>--delete-older-than</option>
    <replaceable>N</replaceable><literal>d</literal>, which deletes
    all user environment generations older than
    <replaceable>N</replaceable> days.  Likewise, <command>nix-env
    --delete-generations</command> accepts a
    <replaceable>N</replaceable><literal>d</literal> age limit.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now heuristically detects whether a build failure was
    due to a disk-full condition. In that case, the build is not
    flagged as &#x201C;permanently failed&#x201D;. This is mostly useful for Hydra,
    which needs to distinguish between permanent and transient build
    failures.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>There is a new symbol <literal>__curPos</literal> that
    expands to an attribute set containing its file name and line and
    column numbers, e.g. <literal>{ file = "foo.nix"; line = 10;
    column = 5; }</literal>.  There also is a new builtin function,
    <varname>unsafeGetAttrPos</varname>, that returns the position of
    an attribute.  This is used by Nixpkgs to provide location
    information in error messages, e.g.

<screen>
$ nix-build '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' -A libreoffice --argstr system x86_64-darwin
error: the package &#x2018;libreoffice-4.0.5.2&#x2019; in &#x2018;.../applications/office/libreoffice/default.nix:263&#x2019;
  is not supported on &#x2018;x86_64-darwin&#x2019;
</screen>

    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The garbage collector is now more concurrent with other Nix
    processes because it releases certain locks earlier.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The binary tarball installer has been improved.  You can now
    install Nix by running:

<screen>
$ bash &lt;(curl https://nixos.org/nix/install)
</screen>

    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>More evaluation errors include position information. For
    instance, selecting a missing attribute will print something like

<screen>
error: attribute `nixUnstabl' missing, at /etc/nixos/configurations/misc/eelco/mandark.nix:216:15
</screen>

    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The command <command>nix-setuid-helper</command> is
    gone.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix no longer uses Automake, but instead has a
    non-recursive, GNU Make-based build system.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>All installed libraries now have the prefix
    <literal>libnix</literal>.  In particular, this gets rid of
    <literal>libutil</literal>, which could clash with libraries with
    the same name from other packages.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now requires a compiler that supports C++11.</para>
  </listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<title>Release 1.6.1 (2013-10-28)</title>

<para>This is primarily a bug fix release.  Changes of interest
are:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix 1.6 accidentally changed the semantics of antiquoted
    paths in strings, such as <literal>"${/foo}/bar"</literal>.  This
    release reverts to the Nix 1.5.3 behaviour.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Previously, Nix optimised expressions such as
    <literal>"${<replaceable>expr</replaceable>}"</literal> to
    <replaceable>expr</replaceable>.  Thus it neither checked whether
    <replaceable>expr</replaceable> could be coerced to a string, nor
    applied such coercions.  This meant that
    <literal>"${123}"</literal> evaluatued to <literal>123</literal>,
    and <literal>"${./foo}"</literal> evaluated to
    <literal>./foo</literal> (even though
    <literal>"${./foo} "</literal> evaluates to
    <literal>"/nix/store/<replaceable>hash</replaceable>-foo "</literal>).
    Nix now checks the type of antiquoted expressions and
    applies coercions.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now shows the exact position of undefined variables.  In
    particular, undefined variable errors in a <literal>with</literal>
    previously didn't show <emphasis>any</emphasis> position
    information, so this makes it a lot easier to fix such
    errors.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Undefined variables are now treated consistently.
    Previously, the <function>tryEval</function> function would catch
    undefined variables inside a <literal>with</literal> but not
    outside.  Now <function>tryEval</function> never catches undefined
    variables.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Bash completion in <command>nix-shell</command> now works
    correctly.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Stack traces are less verbose: they no longer show calls to
    builtin functions and only show a single line for each derivation
    on the call stack.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>New built-in function: <function>builtins.typeOf</function>,
    which returns the type of its argument as a string.</para>
  </listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<title>Release 1.6 (2013-09-10)</title>

<para>In addition to the usual bug fixes, this release has several new
features:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>The command <command>nix-build --run-env</command> has been
    renamed to <command>nix-shell</command>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-shell</command> now sources
    <filename>$stdenv/setup</filename> <emphasis>inside</emphasis> the
    interactive shell, rather than in a parent shell.  This ensures
    that shell functions defined by <literal>stdenv</literal> can be
    used in the interactive shell.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-shell</command> has a new flag
    <option>--pure</option> to clear the environment, so you get an
    environment that more closely corresponds to the &#x201C;real&#x201D; Nix build.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-shell</command> now sets the shell prompt
    (<envar>PS1</envar>) to ensure that Nix shells are distinguishable
    from your regular shells.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-env</command> no longer requires a
    <literal>*</literal> argument to match all packages, so
    <literal>nix-env -qa</literal> is equivalent to <literal>nix-env
    -qa '*'</literal>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para><command>nix-env -i</command> has a new flag
    <option>--remove-all</option> (<option>-r</option>) to remove all
    previous packages from the profile.  This makes it easier to do
    declarative package management similar to NixOS&#x2019;s
    <option>environment.systemPackages</option>.  For instance, if you
    have a specification <filename>my-packages.nix</filename> like this:

<programlisting>
with import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {};
[ thunderbird
  geeqie
  ...
]
</programlisting>

    then after any change to this file, you can run:

<screen>
$ nix-env -f my-packages.nix -ir
</screen>

    to update your profile to match the specification.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The &#x2018;<literal>with</literal>&#x2019; language construct is now more
    lazy.  It only evaluates its argument if a variable might actually
    refer to an attribute in the argument.  For instance, this now
    works:

<programlisting>
let
  pkgs = with pkgs; { foo = "old"; bar = foo; } // overrides;
  overrides = { foo = "new"; };
in pkgs.bar
</programlisting>

    This evaluates to <literal>"new"</literal>, while previously it
    gave an &#x201C;infinite recursion&#x201D; error.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now has proper integer arithmetic operators. For
    instance, you can write <literal>x + y</literal> instead of
    <literal>builtins.add x y</literal>, or <literal>x &lt;
    y</literal> instead of <literal>builtins.lessThan x y</literal>.
    The comparison operators also work on strings.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>On 64-bit systems, Nix integers are now 64 bits rather than
    32 bits.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>When using the Nix daemon, the <command>nix-daemon</command>
    worker process now runs on the same CPU as the client, on systems
    that support setting CPU affinity.  This gives a significant speedup
    on some systems.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>If a stack overflow occurs in the Nix evaluator, you now get
    a proper error message (rather than &#x201C;Segmentation fault&#x201D;) on some
    systems.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>In addition to directories, you can now bind-mount regular
    files in chroots through the (now misnamed) option
    <option>build-chroot-dirs</option>.</para>
  </listitem>

<title>Release 1.4 (2013-02-26)</title>

<para>This release fixes a security bug in multi-user operation.  It
was possible for derivations to cause the mode of files outside of the
Nix store to be changed to 444 (read-only but world-readable) by
creating hard links to those files (<link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/commit/5526a282b5b44e9296e61e07d7d2626a79141ac4">details</link>).</para>

<para>This release has the following improvements and changes:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix has a new binary substituter mechanism: the
    <emphasis>binary cache</emphasis>.  A binary cache contains
    pre-built binaries of Nix packages.  Whenever Nix wants to build a
    missing Nix store path, it will check a set of binary caches to
    see if any of them has a pre-built binary of that path.  The
    configuration setting <option>binary-caches</option> contains a
    list of URLs of binary caches.  For instance, doing
<screen>
$ nix-env -i thunderbird --option binary-caches http://cache.nixos.org
</screen>
    will install Thunderbird and its dependencies, using the available
    pre-built binaries in <uri>http://cache.nixos.org</uri>.
    The main advantage over the old &#x201C;manifest&#x201D;-based method of getting
    pre-built binaries is that you don&#x2019;t have to worry about your
    manifest being in sync with the Nix expressions you&#x2019;re installing
    from; i.e., you don&#x2019;t need to run <command>nix-pull</command> to
    update your manifest.  It&#x2019;s also more scalable because you don&#x2019;t
    need to redownload a giant manifest file every time.
    </para>

    <para>A Nix channel can provide a binary cache URL that will be
    used automatically if you subscribe to that channel.  If you use
    the Nixpkgs or NixOS channels
    (<uri>http://nixos.org/channels</uri>) you automatically get the
    cache <uri>http://cache.nixos.org</uri>.</para>

    <para>Binary caches are created using <command>nix-push</command>.
    For details on the operation and format of binary caches, see the
    <command>nix-push</command> manpage.  More details are provided in
    <link xlink:href="https://nixos.org/nix-dev/2012-September/009826.html">this
    nix-dev posting</link>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Multiple output support should now be usable.  A derivation
    can declare that it wants to produce multiple store paths by
    saying something like
<programlisting>
outputs = [ "lib" "headers" "doc" ];
</programlisting>
    This will cause Nix to pass the intended store path of each output
    to the builder through the environment variables
    <literal>lib</literal>, <literal>headers</literal> and
    <literal>doc</literal>.  Other packages can refer to a specific
    output by referring to
    <literal><replaceable>pkg</replaceable>.<replaceable>output</replaceable></literal>,
    e.g.
<programlisting>
buildInputs = [ pkg.lib pkg.headers ];
</programlisting>
    If you install a package with multiple outputs using
    <command>nix-env</command>, each output path will be symlinked
    into the user environment.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Dashes are now valid as part of identifiers and attribute
    names.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The new operation <command>nix-store --repair-path</command>
    allows corrupted or missing store paths to be repaired by
    redownloading them.  <command>nix-store --verify --check-contents
    --repair</command> will scan and repair all paths in the Nix
    store.  Similarly, <command>nix-env</command>,
    <command>nix-build</command>, <command>nix-instantiate</command>
    and <command>nix-store --realise</command> have a
    <option>--repair</option> flag to detect and fix bad paths by
    rebuilding or redownloading them.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix no longer sets the immutable bit on files in the Nix
    store.  Instead, the recommended way to guard the Nix store
    against accidental modification on Linux is to make it a read-only
    bind mount, like this:

<screen>
$ mount --bind /nix/store /nix/store
$ mount -o remount,ro,bind /nix/store
</screen>

    Nix will automatically make <filename>/nix/store</filename>
    writable as needed (using a private mount namespace) to allow
    modifications.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Store optimisation (replacing identical files in the store
    with hard links) can now be done automatically every time a path
    is added to the store.  This is enabled by setting the
    configuration option <literal>auto-optimise-store</literal> to
    <literal>true</literal> (disabled by default).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now supports <command>xz</command> compression for NARs
    in addition to <command>bzip2</command>.  It compresses about 30%
    better on typical archives and decompresses about twice as
    fast.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Basic Nix expression evaluation profiling: setting the
    environment variable <envar>NIX_COUNT_CALLS</envar> to
    <literal>1</literal> will cause Nix to print how many times each
    primop or function was executed.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>New primops: <varname>concatLists</varname>,
    <varname>elem</varname>, <varname>elemAt</varname> and
    <varname>filter</varname>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The command <command>nix-copy-closure</command> has a new
    flag <option>--use-substitutes</option> (<option>-s</option>) to
    download missing paths on the target machine using the substitute
    mechanism.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The command <command>nix-worker</command> has been renamed
    to <command>nix-daemon</command>.  Support for running the Nix
    worker in &#x201C;slave&#x201D; mode has been removed.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The <option>--help</option> flag of every Nix command now
    invokes <command>man</command>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Chroot builds are now supported on systemd machines.</para>

<title>Release 1.1 (2012-07-18)</title>

<para>This release has the following improvements:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>On Linux, when doing a chroot build, Nix now uses various
    namespace features provided by the Linux kernel to improve
    build isolation.  Namely:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>The private network namespace ensures that
      builders cannot talk to the outside world (or vice versa): each
      build only sees a private loopback interface.  This also means
      that two concurrent builds can listen on the same port (e.g. as
      part of a test) without conflicting with each
      other.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The PID namespace causes each build to start as
      PID 1.  Processes outside of the chroot are not visible to those
      on the inside.  On the other hand, processes inside the chroot
      <emphasis>are</emphasis> visible from the outside (though with
      different PIDs).</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The IPC namespace prevents the builder from
      communicating with outside processes using SysV IPC mechanisms
      (shared memory, message queues, semaphores).  It also ensures
      that all IPC objects are destroyed when the builder
      exits.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The UTS namespace ensures that builders see a
      hostname of <literal>localhost</literal> rather than the actual
      hostname.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>The private mount namespace was already used by
      Nix to ensure that the bind-mounts used to set up the chroot are
      cleaned up automatically.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Build logs are now compressed using
    <command>bzip2</command>.  The command <command>nix-store
    -l</command> decompresses them on the fly.  This can be disabled
    by setting the option <literal>build-compress-log</literal> to
    <literal>false</literal>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The creation of build logs in
    <filename>/nix/var/log/nix/drvs</filename> can be disabled by
    setting the new option <literal>build-keep-log</literal> to
    <literal>false</literal>.  This is useful, for instance, for Hydra
    build machines.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now reserves some space in
    <filename>/nix/var/nix/db/reserved</filename> to ensure that the
    garbage collector can run successfully if the disk is full.  This
    is necessary because SQLite transactions fail if the disk is
    full.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Added a basic <function>fetchurl</function> function.  This
    is not intended to replace the <function>fetchurl</function> in
    Nixpkgs, but is useful for bootstrapping; e.g., it will allow us
    to get rid of the bootstrap binaries in the Nixpkgs source tree
    and download them instead.  You can use it by doing
    <literal>import &lt;nix/fetchurl.nix&gt; { url =
    <replaceable>url</replaceable>; sha256 =
    "<replaceable>hash</replaceable>"; }</literal>. (Shea Levy)</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Improved RPM spec file. (Michel Alexandre Salim)</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Support for on-demand socket-based activation in the Nix
    daemon with <command>systemd</command>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Added a manpage for
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nix.conf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>When using the Nix daemon, the <option>-s</option> flag in
    <command>nix-env -qa</command> is now much faster.</para>

<title>Release 1.0 (2012-05-11)</title>

<para>There have been numerous improvements and bug fixes since the
previous release.  Here are the most significant:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix can now optionally use the Boehm garbage collector.
    This significantly reduces the Nix evaluator&#x2019;s memory footprint,
    especially when evaluating large NixOS system configurations.  It
    can be enabled using the <option>--enable-gc</option> configure
    option.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now uses SQLite for its database.  This is faster and
    more flexible than the old <emphasis>ad hoc</emphasis> format.
    SQLite is also used to cache the manifests in
    <filename>/nix/var/nix/manifests</filename>, resulting in a
    significant speedup.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix now has an search path for expressions.  The search path
    is set using the environment variable <envar>NIX_PATH</envar> and
    the <option>-I</option> command line option.  In Nix expressions,
    paths between angle brackets are used to specify files that must
    be looked up in the search path.  For instance, the expression
    <literal>&lt;nixpkgs/default.nix&gt;</literal> looks for a file
    <filename>nixpkgs/default.nix</filename> relative to every element
    in the search path.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The new command <command>nix-build --run-env</command>
    builds all dependencies of a derivation, then starts a shell in an
    environment containing all variables from the derivation.  This is
    useful for reproducing the environment of a derivation for
    development.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The new command <command>nix-store --verify-path</command>
    verifies that the contents of a store path have not
    changed.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The new command <command>nix-store --print-env</command>
    prints out the environment of a derivation in a format that can be
    evaluated by a shell.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Attribute names can now be arbitrary strings.  For instance,
    you can write <literal>{ "foo-1.2" = &#x2026;; "bla bla" = &#x2026;; }."bla
    bla"</literal>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Attribute selection can now provide a default value using
    the <literal>or</literal> operator.  For instance, the expression
    <literal>x.y.z or e</literal> evaluates to the attribute
    <literal>x.y.z</literal> if it exists, and <literal>e</literal>
    otherwise.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The right-hand side of the <literal>?</literal> operator can
    now be an attribute path, e.g., <literal>attrs ?
    a.b.c</literal>.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>On Linux, Nix will now make files in the Nix store immutable
    on filesystems that support it.  This prevents accidental
    modification of files in the store by the root user.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix has preliminary support for derivations with multiple
    outputs.  This is useful because it allows parts of a package to
    be deployed and garbage-collected separately.  For instance,
    development parts of a package such as header files or static
    libraries would typically not be part of the closure of an
    application, resulting in reduced disk usage and installation
    time.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The Nix store garbage collector is faster and holds the
    global lock for a shorter amount of time.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>The option <option>--timeout</option> (corresponding to the
    configuration setting <literal>build-timeout</literal>) allows you
    to set an absolute timeout on builds &#x2014; if a build runs for more than
    the given number of seconds, it is terminated.  This is useful for
    recovering automatically from builds that are stuck in an infinite
    loop but keep producing output, and for which
    <literal>--max-silent-time</literal> is ineffective.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix development has moved to GitHub (<link xlink:href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix"/>).</para>

<title>Release 0.16 (2010-08-17)</title>

<para>This release has the following improvements:</para>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>The Nix expression evaluator is now much faster in most
    cases: typically, <link xlink:href="http://www.mail-archive.com/nix-dev@cs.uu.nl/msg04113.html">3
    to 8 times compared to the old implementation</link>.  It also
    uses less memory.  It no longer depends on the ATerm
    library.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>
      Support for configurable parallelism inside builders.  Build
      scripts have always had the ability to perform multiple build
      actions in parallel (for instance, by running <command>make -j
      2</command>), but this was not desirable because the number of
      actions to be performed in parallel was not configurable.  Nix
      now has an option <option>--cores
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></option> as well as a configuration
      setting <varname>build-cores =
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></varname> that causes the
      environment variable <envar>NIX_BUILD_CORES</envar> to be set to
      <replaceable>N</replaceable> when the builder is invoked.  The
      builder can use this at its discretion to perform a parallel
      build, e.g., by calling <command>make -j
      <replaceable>N</replaceable></command>.  In Nixpkgs, this can be
      enabled on a per-package basis by setting the derivation
      attribute <varname>enableParallelBuilding</varname> to
      <literal>true</literal>.

<title>Release 0.12 (2008-11-20)</title>

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem>
    <para>Nix no longer uses Berkeley DB to store Nix store metadata.
    The principal advantages of the new storage scheme are: it works
    properly over decent implementations of NFS (allowing Nix stores
    to be shared between multiple machines); no recovery is needed
    when a Nix process crashes; no write access is needed for
    read-only operations; no more running out of Berkeley DB locks on
    certain operations.</para>

    <para>You still need to compile Nix with Berkeley DB support if
    you want Nix to automatically convert your old Nix store to the
    new schema.  If you don&#x2019;t need this, you can build Nix with the
    <filename>configure</filename> option
    <option>--disable-old-db-compat</option>.</para>

    <para>After the automatic conversion to the new schema, you can
    delete the old Berkeley DB files:

    <screen>
$ cd /nix/var/nix/db
$ rm __db* log.* derivers references referrers reserved validpaths DB_CONFIG</screen>

    The new metadata is stored in the directories
    <filename>/nix/var/nix/db/info</filename> and
    <filename>/nix/var/nix/db/referrer</filename>.  Though the
    metadata is stored in human-readable plain-text files, they are
    not intended to be human-editable, as Nix is rather strict about
    the format.</para>

    <para>The new storage schema may or may not require less disk
    space than the Berkeley DB environment, mostly depending on the
    cluster size of your file system.  With 1 KiB clusters (which
    seems to be the <literal>ext3</literal> default nowadays) it
    usually takes up much less space.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>There is a new substituter that copies paths
  directly from other (remote) Nix stores mounted somewhere in the
  filesystem.  For instance, you can speed up an installation by
  mounting some remote Nix store that already has the packages in
  question via NFS or <literal>sshfs</literal>.  The environment
  variable <envar>NIX_OTHER_STORES</envar> specifies the locations of
  the remote Nix directories,
  e.g. <literal>/mnt/remote-fs/nix</literal>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>New <command>nix-store</command> operations
  <option>--dump-db</option> and <option>--load-db</option> to dump
  and reload the Nix database.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The garbage collector has a number of new options to
  allow only some of the garbage to be deleted.  The option
  <option>--max-freed <replaceable>N</replaceable></option> tells the

  <replaceable>N</replaceable></option> tells it to stop after the
  link count on <filename>/nix/store</filename> has dropped below
  <replaceable>N</replaceable>.  This is useful for very large Nix
  stores on filesystems with a 32000 subdirectories limit (like
  <literal>ext3</literal>).  The option <option>--use-atime</option>
  causes store paths to be deleted in order of ascending last access
  time.  This allows non-recently used stuff to be deleted.  The
  option <option>--max-atime <replaceable>time</replaceable></option>
  specifies an upper limit to the last accessed time of paths that may
  be deleted.  For instance,

    <screen>
    $ nix-store --gc -v --max-atime $(date +%s -d "2 months ago")</screen>

  deletes everything that hasn&#x2019;t been accessed in two months.</para></listitem>

<title>Release 0.11 (2007-12-31)</title>

<para>Nix 0.11 has many improvements over the previous stable release.
The most important improvement is secure multi-user support.  It also
features many usability enhancements and language extensions, many of
them prompted by NixOS, the purely functional Linux distribution based
on Nix.  Here is an (incomplete) list:</para>


<itemizedlist>


  <listitem><para>Secure multi-user support.  A single Nix store can
  now be shared between multiple (possible untrusted) users.  This is
  an important feature for NixOS, where it allows non-root users to
  install software.  The old setuid method for sharing a store between
  multiple users has been removed.  Details for setting up a
  multi-user store can be found in the manual.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>The new command <command>nix-copy-closure</command>
  gives you an easy and efficient way to exchange software between
  machines.  It copies the missing parts of the closure of a set of
  store path to or from a remote machine via
  <command>ssh</command>.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>A new kind of string literal: strings between double
  single-quotes (<literal>''</literal>) have indentation
  &#x201C;intelligently&#x201D; removed.  This allows large strings (such as shell
  scripts or configuration file fragments in NixOS) to cleanly follow
  the indentation of the surrounding expression.  It also requires
  much less escaping, since <literal>''</literal> is less common in
  most languages than <literal>"</literal>.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> <option>--set</option>
  modifies the current generation of a profile so that it contains
  exactly the specified derivation, and nothing else.  For example,
  <literal>nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/browser --set
  firefox</literal> lets the profile named
  <filename>browser</filename> contain just Firefox.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> now maintains
  meta-information about installed packages in profiles.  The
  meta-information is the contents of the <varname>meta</varname>
  attribute of derivations, such as <varname>description</varname> or
  <varname>homepage</varname>.  The command <literal>nix-env -q --xml
  --meta</literal> shows all meta-information.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env</command> now uses the
  <varname>meta.priority</varname> attribute of derivations to resolve
  filename collisions between packages.  Lower priority values denote
  a higher priority.  For instance, the GCC wrapper package and the
  Binutils package in Nixpkgs both have a file
  <filename>bin/ld</filename>, so previously if you tried to install
  both you would get a collision.  Now, on the other hand, the GCC
  wrapper declares a higher priority than Binutils, so the former&#x2019;s
  <filename>bin/ld</filename> is symlinked in the user
  environment.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env -i / -u</command>: instead of
  breaking package ties by version, break them by priority and version
  number.  That is, if there are multiple packages with the same name,
  then pick the package with the highest priority, and only use the
  version if there are multiple packages with the same
  priority.</para>

  <para>This makes it possible to mark specific versions/variant in
  Nixpkgs more or less desirable than others.  A typical example would
  be a beta version of some package (e.g.,
  <literal>gcc-4.2.0rc1</literal>) which should not be installed even
  though it is the highest version, except when it is explicitly
  selected (e.g., <literal>nix-env -i
  gcc-4.2.0rc1</literal>).</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env --set-flag</command> allows meta
  attributes of installed packages to be modified.  There are several
  attributes that can be usefully modified, because they affect the
  behaviour of <command>nix-env</command> or the user environment
  build script:

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><varname>meta.priority</varname> can be changed
      to resolve filename clashes (see above).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><varname>meta.keep</varname> can be set to
      <literal>true</literal> to prevent the package from being
      upgraded or replaced.  Useful if you want to hang on to an older
      version of a package.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para><varname>meta.active</varname> can be set to
      <literal>false</literal> to &#x201C;disable&#x201D; the package.  That is, no
      symlinks will be generated to the files of the package, but it
      remains part of the profile (so it won&#x2019;t be garbage-collected).
      Set it back to <literal>true</literal> to re-enable the
      package.</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

  </para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-env -q</command> now has a flag
  <option>--prebuilt-only</option> (<option>-b</option>) that causes
  <command>nix-env</command> to show only those derivations whose
  output is already in the Nix store or that can be substituted (i.e.,
  downloaded from somewhere).  In other words, it shows the packages
  that can be installed &#x201C;quickly&#x201D;, i.e., don&#x2019;t need to be built from
  source.  The <option>-b</option> flag is also available in
  <command>nix-env -i</command> and <command>nix-env -u</command> to
  filter out derivations for which no pre-built binary is
  available.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>The new option <option>--argstr</option> (in
  <command>nix-env</command>, <command>nix-instantiate</command> and
  <command>nix-build</command>) is like <option>--arg</option>, except
  that the value is a string.  For example, <literal>--argstr system
  i686-linux</literal> is equivalent to <literal>--arg system
  \"i686-linux\"</literal> (note that <option>--argstr</option>
  prevents annoying quoting around shell arguments).</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-store</command> has a new operation
  <option>--read-log</option> (<option>-l</option>)
  <parameter>paths</parameter> that shows the build log of the given
  paths.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The option <option>--max-silent-time</option>
  (corresponding to the configuration setting
  <literal>build-max-silent-time</literal>) allows you to set a
  timeout on builds &#x2014; if a build produces no output on
  <literal>stdout</literal> or <literal>stderr</literal> for the given
  number of seconds, it is terminated.  This is useful for recovering
  automatically from builds that are stuck in an infinite
  loop.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-channel</command>: each subscribed
  channel is its own attribute in the top-level expression generated
  for the channel.  This allows disambiguation (e.g. <literal>nix-env
  -i -A nixpkgs_unstable.firefox</literal>).</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>The substitutes table has been removed from the
  database.  This makes operations such as <command>nix-pull</command>
  and <command>nix-channel --update</command> much, much
  faster.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-pull</command> now supports
  bzip2-compressed manifests.  This speeds up
  channels.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-prefetch-url</command> now has a
  limited form of caching.  This is used by
  <command>nix-channel</command> to prevent unnecessary downloads when
  the channel hasn&#x2019;t changed.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><command>nix-prefetch-url</command> now by default
  computes the SHA-256 hash of the file instead of the MD5 hash.  In
  calls to <function>fetchurl</function> you should pass the
  <literal>sha256</literal> attribute instead of
  <literal>md5</literal>.  You can pass either a hexadecimal or a
  base-32 encoding of the hash.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>Nix can now perform builds in an automatically
  generated &#x201C;chroot&#x201D;.  This prevents a builder from accessing stuff
  outside of the Nix store, and thus helps ensure purity.  This is an
  experimental feature.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>The new command <command>nix-store
  --optimise</command> reduces Nix store disk space usage by finding
  identical files in the store and hard-linking them to each other.
  It typically reduces the size of the store by something like
  25-35%.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para><filename>~/.nix-defexpr</filename> can now be a
  directory, in which case the Nix expressions in that directory are
  combined into an attribute set, with the file names used as the
  names of the attributes.  The command <command>nix-env
  --import</command> (which set the
  <filename>~/.nix-defexpr</filename> symlink) is
  removed.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>Derivations can specify the new special attribute
  <varname>allowedReferences</varname> to enforce that the references
  in the output of a derivation are a subset of a declared set of
  paths.  For example, if <varname>allowedReferences</varname> is an
  empty list, then the output must not have any references.  This is
  used in NixOS to check that generated files such as initial ramdisks
  for booting Linux don&#x2019;t have any dependencies.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>The new attribute
  <varname>exportReferencesGraph</varname> allows builders access to
  the references graph of their inputs.  This is used in NixOS for
  tasks such as generating ISO-9660 images that contain a Nix store
  populated with the closure of certain paths.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>Fixed-output derivations (like
  <function>fetchurl</function>) can define the attribute
  <varname>impureEnvVars</varname> to allow external environment
  variables to be passed to builders.  This is used in Nixpkgs to
  support proxy configuration, among other things.</para></listitem>


  <listitem><para>Several new built-in functions:
  <function>builtins.attrNames</function>,
  <function>builtins.filterSource</function>,
  <function>builtins.isAttrs</function>,
  <function>builtins.isFunction</function>,
  <function>builtins.listToAttrs</function>,

<title>Release 0.9 (2005-09-16)</title>

<para>NOTE: this version of Nix uses Berkeley DB 4.3 instead of 4.2.
The database is upgraded automatically, but you should be careful not
to use old versions of Nix that still use Berkeley DB 4.2.  In
particular, if you use a Nix installed through Nix, you should run

<screen>
$ nix-store --clear-substitutes</screen>

  <listitem><para>Nix now uses Berkeley DB 4.3.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The <function>derivation</function> primitive is
  lazier.  Attributes of dependent derivations can mutually refer to
  each other (as long as there are no data dependencies on the
  <varname>outPath</varname> and <varname>drvPath</varname> attributes
  computed by <function>derivation</function>).</para>

  <para>For example, the expression <literal>derivation
  attrs</literal> now evaluates to (essentially)

  <programlisting>
attrs // {
  type = "derivation";
  outPath = derivation! attrs;
  drvPath = derivation! attrs;
}</programlisting>

  where <function>derivation!</function> is a primop that does the
  actual derivation instantiation (i.e., it does what
  <function>derivation</function> used to do).  The advantage is that
  it allows commands such as <command>nix-env -qa</command> and
  <command>nix-env -i</command> to be much faster since they no longer
  need to instantiate all derivations, just the
  <varname>name</varname> attribute.</para>

  <para>Also, it allows derivations to cyclically reference each
  other, for example,

  <programlisting>
webServer = derivation {
  ...
  hostName = "svn.cs.uu.nl";
  services = [svnService];
};
 
svnService = derivation {
  ...
  hostName = webServer.hostName;

<title>Release 0.8 (2005-04-11)</title>

<para>NOTE: the hashing scheme in Nix 0.8 changed (as detailed below).
As a result, <command>nix-pull</command> manifests and channels built
for Nix 0.7 and below will not work anymore.  However, the Nix
expression language has not changed, so you can still build from
source.  Also, existing user environments continue to work.  Nix 0.8
will automatically upgrade the database schema of previous
installations when it is first run.</para>

<para>If you get the error message

<screen>
you have an old-style manifest `/nix/var/nix/manifests/[...]'; please
delete it</screen>

you should delete previously downloaded manifests:

<screen>
$ rm /nix/var/nix/manifests/*</screen>

If <command>nix-channel</command> gives the error message

<screen>
manifest `http://catamaran.labs.cs.uu.nl/dist/nix/channels/[channel]/MANIFEST'
is too old (i.e., for Nix &lt;= 0.7)</screen>

then you should unsubscribe from the offending channel
(<command>nix-channel --remove
<replaceable>URL</replaceable></command>; leave out
<literal>/MANIFEST</literal>), and subscribe to the same URL, with
<literal>channels</literal> replaced by <literal>channels-v3</literal>
(e.g., <link xlink:href="http://catamaran.labs.cs.uu.nl/dist/nix/channels-v3/nixpkgs-unstable"/>).</para>

<para>Nix 0.8 has the following improvements:

<itemizedlist>

  <listitem><para>The cryptographic hashes used in store paths are now
  160 bits long, but encoded in base-32 so that they are still only 32
  characters long (e.g.,
  <filename>/nix/store/csw87wag8bqlqk7ipllbwypb14xainap-atk-1.9.0</filename>).
  (This is actually a 160 bit truncation of a SHA-256
  hash.)</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Big cleanups and simplifications of the basic store
  semantics.  The notion of &#x201C;closure store expressions&#x201D; is gone (and
  so is the notion of &#x201C;successors&#x201D;); the file system references of a
  store path are now just stored in the database.</para>

  <para>For instance, given any store path, you can query its closure:

  <screen>
$ nix-store -qR $(which firefox)
... lots of paths ...</screen>

  Also, Nix now remembers for each store path the derivation that
  built it (the &#x201C;deriver&#x201D;):

  <screen>
$ nix-store -qR $(which firefox)
/nix/store/4b0jx7vq80l9aqcnkszxhymsf1ffa5jd-firefox-1.0.1.drv</screen>

  So to see the build-time dependencies, you can do

  <screen>
$ nix-store -qR $(nix-store -qd $(which firefox))</screen>

  or, in a nicer format:

  <screen>
$ nix-store -q --tree $(nix-store -qd $(which firefox))</screen>

  </para>

  <para>File system references are also stored in reverse.  For
  instance, you can query all paths that directly or indirectly use a
  certain Glibc:

  <screen>
$ nix-store -q --referrers-closure \
    /nix/store/8lz9yc6zgmc0vlqmn2ipcpkjlmbi51vv-glibc-2.3.4</screen>

  </para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>The concept of fixed-output derivations has been
  formalised.  Previously, functions such as
  <function>fetchurl</function> in Nixpkgs used a hack (namely,
  explicitly specifying a store path hash) to prevent changes to, say,
  the URL of the file from propagating upwards through the dependency
  graph, causing rebuilds of everything.  This can now be done cleanly
  by specifying the <varname>outputHash</varname> and
  <varname>outputHashAlgo</varname> attributes.  Nix itself checks
  that the content of the output has the specified hash.  (This is
  important for maintaining certain invariants necessary for future
  work on secure shared stores.)</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>One-click installation :-) It is now possible to
  install any top-level component in Nixpkgs directly, through the web
  &#x2014; see, e.g., <link xlink:href="http://catamaran.labs.cs.uu.nl/dist/nixpkgs-0.8/"/>.
  All you have to do is associate
  <filename>/nix/bin/nix-install-package</filename> with the MIME type
  <literal>application/nix-package</literal> (or the extension
  <filename>.nixpkg</filename>), and clicking on a package link will
  cause it to be installed, with all appropriate dependencies.  If you
  just want to install some specific application, this is easier than
  subscribing to a channel.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-store -r
  <replaceable>PATHS</replaceable></command> now builds all the
  derivations PATHS in parallel.  Previously it did them sequentially
  (though exploiting possible parallelism between subderivations).
  This is nice for build farms.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><command>nix-channel</command> has new operations
  <option>--list</option> and
  <option>--remove</option>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>New ways of installing components into user
  environments:

  <itemizedlist>

    <listitem><para>Copy from another user environment:

    <screen>
$ nix-env -i --from-profile .../other-profile firefox</screen>

    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Install a store derivation directly (bypassing the
    Nix expression language entirely):

    <screen>
$ nix-env -i /nix/store/z58v41v21xd3...-aterm-2.3.1.drv</screen>

    (This is used to implement <command>nix-install-package</command>,
    which is therefore immune to evolution in the Nix expression
    language.)</para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Install an already built store path directly:

    <screen>
$ nix-env -i /nix/store/hsyj5pbn0d9i...-aterm-2.3.1</screen>

    </para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>Install the result of a Nix expression specified
    as a command-line argument:

    <screen>
$ nix-env -f .../i686-linux.nix -i -E 'x: x.firefoxWrapper'</screen>

    The difference with the normal installation mode is that
    <option>-E</option> does not use the <varname>name</varname>
    attributes of derivations.  Therefore, this can be used to
    disambiguate multiple derivations with the same
    name.</para></listitem>

  </itemizedlist></para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>A hash of the contents of a store path is now stored
  in the database after a successful build.  This allows you to check
  whether store paths have been tampered with: <command>nix-store
  --verify --check-contents</command>.</para></listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para>Implemented a concurrent garbage collector.  It is now
    always safe to run the garbage collector, even if other Nix
    operations are happening simultaneously.</para>

    <para>However, there can still be GC races if you use
    <command>nix-instantiate</command> and <command>nix-store
    --realise</command> directly to build things.  To prevent races,
    use the <option>--add-root</option> flag of those commands.</para>

  </listitem>

  <listitem><para>The garbage collector now finally deletes paths in
  the right order (i.e., topologically sorted under the &#x201C;references&#x201D;
  relation), thus making it safe to interrupt the collector without
  risking a store that violates the closure
  invariant.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>Likewise, the substitute mechanism now downloads
  files in the right order, thus preserving the closure invariant at
  all times.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para>The result of <command>nix-build</command> is now
  registered as a root of the garbage collector.  If the
  <filename>./result</filename> link is deleted, the GC root
  disappears automatically.</para></listitem>

  <listitem>

    <para>The behaviour of the garbage collector can be changed
    globally by setting options in
    <filename>/nix/etc/nix/nix.conf</filename>.

    <itemizedlist>

      <listitem><para><literal>gc-keep-derivations</literal> specifies
