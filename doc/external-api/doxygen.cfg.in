# Doxyfile 1.9.5

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Nix"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = @PACKAGE_VERSION@

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Nix, the purely functional package manager: C API (experimental)"

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# FIXME Make this list more maintainable somehow. We could maybe generate this
# in the Makefile, but we would need to change how `.in` files are preprocessed
# so they can expand variables despite configure variables.

INPUT                  = \
  src/libutil-c \
  src/libexpr-c \

FILE_PATTERNS = nix_api_*.h *.md

# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that
# contain include files that are not input files but should be processed by the
# preprocessor. Note that the INCLUDE_PATH is not recursive, so the setting of
# RECURSIVE has no effect here.
# This tag requires that the tag SEARCH_INCLUDES is set to YES.
